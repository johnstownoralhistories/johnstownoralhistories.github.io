# Family Restructured: Continuity and Change in the Families of Steelworkers in Johnstown Pennsylvania during Deindustrialization
### An Oral History Analysis
### Alexis Shoulta 12/15/2025

## Introduction
Although I did not grow up in the shadow of the steel mills of Johnstown, Pennsylvania, they have loomed over my life through family memory. From the 1960s through the 1980s my grandfather moved from job to job as the steel industry rapidly declined across the United States. While this experience was far from uncommon, when I turned to the secondary and primary sources of deindustrialization, I noticed a large archival silence. Because of the composition of the steel industry, oral histories frequently center male workers and job loss, but rarely documented the experiences of wives and children whose lives were also shaped by the economic instability. However, growing up, it was primarily stories from my grandmother and mother that shaped my understanding of deindustrialization in Johnstown.

Even though I had not initially started my capstone project with the intention of doing an oral histories or completing a thesis, I felt that creating a collection of primary source archival materials from my family’s community and analyzing those oral histories would be a good opportunity to preserve my family’s experiences with deindustrialization. Where other oral history projects have addressed what the closure of industrialized workplaces means to its workers and how they feel, instead I am interested in examining how the whole family was collectively impacted. 

My analysis of these oral histories asks, how did deindustrialization affect family structures and gendered roles within steelworker households in Johnstown? Additionally, what do oral histories reveal about how wives and children experienced and interpreted these changes? This paper argues that deindustrialization in Johnstown, Pennsylvania reshaped lives of steel working families by intensifying women’ economic and emotional labor, while also making economic instability a defining feature of childhood.

## Historiography
Deindustrialization has been approached by many scholars across disciplines, including labor, social and gender history. In _The Way We Never Were_, Stephanie Coontz challenges modern misunderstandings of a “traditional family model” does not acknowledge the diversity of family life throughout history.[^1] She analyzes how for working class families, growth in income in the 1960s combined with few job opportunities for women created the conditions of single-income family units among people who historically have needed a dual income stream to survive.[^2]

Ewa Morawska, in _For Bread with Butter: The Life-Worlds of East Central Europeans in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, 1890-1940_ interviews and analyzes the generation of East Central Europeans who immigrated and worked in Johnstown between 1890 and 1940. She argues that Eastern Central European families’ adaptations to the industrial world shaped the broader character and attitudes of the American working class in Johnstown.[^3] 

In _Wives of Steel_, Karen Olson builds on the work of Stephanie Coontz, applying gendered analysis the labor of women in the steelmaking community of Sparrows Point, Maryland.[^4] Through her analysis of the history of Sparrows Point, Olson criticizes the rise and fall narrative of the steel industry that only centralizes the role of white men and obscures the economic disenfranchisement of workers of color and the economic contributions of women.[^5] 

This project builds on these scholars by shifting the oral history focus from industrialized work itself to the impacts felt by family as participants. Rather than examining deindustrialization as a singular event, this paper treats it as prolonged process, felt across decades and generations. Through this lens I study how deindustrialization impacted gender roles, caregiving responsibilities, and childhood experiences within steelworker households in Johnstown. By using the oral histories of wives and children this study addresses this archival silence and contributes a more comprehensive understanding of how industrial decline impacts an entire community.

## Historical Context Johnstown Pennsylvania
The town of Johnstown was founded in 1800 by Joseph Schantz in Western Pennsylvania. It sits  in the Allegheny mountains in a valley between the intersection of three rivers, which have been a continual source of flooding. Johnstown’s primary natural resources are coal and iron, which supported the growth of the mining and steel working industries in the town during the late 19th century.[^6] During this period, Johnstown was economically dominated by one company, the Bethlehem Steel company, formerly the Cambria Steel Company.[^7]

In the 1970s and 1980s, industrialized work in the United States entered a period of sharp decline. In her article, “Deindustrialization and the Postindustrial City, 1950-Present,” Chloe Taft writes, “At the community level, corporations faced additional incentives to move out of urban cores and take tens of thousands of jobs with them.”[^8] According to the Bureau for Labor Statistics manufacturing employment in the United States was at its peak in 1979, making up 22% of total nonfarm employment, but by only accounted for 9% in 2020.[^9] In Johnstown unemployment reached 20% by the 1970s, as plants began closing.[^10]

## Economic and Emotional Labor: Wives of Steelworkers as Mothers and Homemakers
Deindustrialization reshaped the gendered roles within steelworker households in Johnstown by increasing the economic and emotional labor performed by wives. Furthermore, access to healthcare and assistance heavily influenced women’s ability to work and to supplement their husband’s income during this period.

Among the interviews collected for this archive, both families represented embodied traditional gender roles. Both Ruth and Joyce Homan’s mother had jobs they left once they were married.[^11] And despite the loss of income from their husbands' multiple layoffs ultimately neither woman returned to the workforce. Ruth describes herself as a “homemaker” in contrast to her husband, Tom who was the “breadwinner.”[^12] Her jobs within the family were to cook, clean, look after the kids, care for her mother who lived with them for a time, and to care for her daughter who had Spinal Muscular Atrophy.[^13] In Joyce Homan’s family, she recalls her mother as “the connecting part of our house.”[^14] She describes her role as, “She kept the house, she cooked for us… all the emotional labor, I would say, pretty much fell to her.”[^15]

Both the Demkos and the Homans began to have economic trouble because of closures in the steel mills. Tom, who worked for U.S. Steel in Johnstown as a draftsman, would work for short periods and then be laid off again, cycling through jobs rapidly, unable to establish consistency. Ruth describes this stating, “He'd get back to work and then he'd lay off, and back to work and lay off. And in the last one big, big, big time, he didn't work for 15 months. That was hard.”[^16] Joyce Homan’s family, whose father worked on the Bethlehem Steel mill floor as a laborer, also experienced several rounds of layoffs, however he eventually ended up retiring. During layoffs, her father would work short construction jobs to supplement family income.[^17]

Although neither woman work jobs, both Ruth Demko and Joyce Homan’s mother took on essential economic labor to keep their households functioning through crisis. Ruth, who oversaw managing the family’s money, cut back on non-essential food items, and prioritizing foods that were both affordable as well as multifunctional. She recalls, “I would buy a little chicken, and you’d eat chicken as a chicken. You’d eat chicken in soup. You would eat chicken about three different ways from one little chicken…It was money-saving things.”[^18] Joyce’s mother looked for sales and clipped coupons.[^19] Both mothers began making their children’s clothing or organizing hand-me-downs from friends and family to save money.[^20]

Additionally, both women began doing further emotional labor because of the way the work impacted their husbands. For Ruth, although her husband’s layoffs initially granted her some assistance with childcare while he was home, when Tom had to begin leaving home weeks at a time to work in other cities, she was left to do everything by herself.[^21] She described parenting as “challenging” without her husband being there to support her.[^22] And in his absences, she had to make decisions about her children’s educational and romantic lives alone. She recalls when her daughter wanted to begin dating, “her dad wasn’t home, so all I kept telling her was you’re too young for this. I would not tell her she could not do it. I just told her she was too young, and I didn’t have her dad’s support right there with me.”[^23] 

For the Homan family, Joyce recalls her father struggling mentally in response to his job loss. She states, “I also remember, my dad was just very depressed during that time when he was laid off…sort of like you were going to work very, very hard. And if you have that taken away, that was like a big part of your identity.”[^24] As a result, Joyce’s mother took on even more of the emotional component than what she was already carrying. Joyce recalls, “I mean, that was a hard, you know, and my mom’s trying to take care of us, take care of herself, help her husband. It was a lot. It was a lot.”[^25]

Both Ruth and Joyce note, some women in Johnstown were always working regardless of their marriage status, and other began to work to supplement their family income.[^26] Although one of the primary causes of both women staying home at the time were gender expectations, both Ruth and Mrs. Homan’s reasoning to remain at home were intensified by the boundaries healthcare created to women being able to enter the workforce.

When asked why she didn’t return to work, Ruth stated, “No, I didn’t. I had Dana to take care of. I couldn’t go back and work. I mean, I don’t know. It would have been a trade-off.”[^27] Because her daughter Dana required full-time care for her SMA, it would not have been possible for Ruth to work outside the home and care for her at the same time. Additionally, for a short period, Ruth was also responsible for being the caretaker for her mother with Parkinson’s.

For the Homan family, Joyce recalls that her mother had a cardiovascular health condition. She states, “my mom was physically, she had a heart condition, she had a hole in her heart…so I don’t think she could have done both. I don’t think she could have had kids and worked as well, would have been too hard on her physically.”[^28] Additionally, because her mother needed healthcare, this added stress and dependency for Joyce’s family to get work with benefits in the steel mills. Later when Joyce was in college, her father asked her for assistance in writing a letter to protect his pension. He was worried if something happened to him on the job, without the ability to get income, his wife wouldn’t have an ability to sustain herself. Joyce describes her father stating, “I think he felt very strongly that she wasn’t going to be able to go out and get a job if something happened to him, you know, physically.”[^29]

As described by Coontz, for women, “full-time jobs were scarce, job tenures were short, and pay was low,” making pursuing paid labor an unreliable to solution to their caretaking and economic hardships.[^30] For Ruth and Mrs. Homan, returning to the workforce was not only a question of family and gender ideology, but the practical impossibility due to either their necessity as a caretaker or personal health complications. Additionally, deindustrialization intensified women’s domestic economic and emotional labor, even if some women did return to the workforce. Together these interviews show that women’s unpaid labor was central to sustaining their households through prolonged economic instability.

## Class Identity Formation and Educational Mobility: The Children of Steelworkers from Primary to Tertiary Education
For the children of steelworker households, deindustrialization reshaped childhood by making economic instability socially visible, emotionally formative, and later central to how they later understood education. For Karen Shoulta and Joyce Homan, the poverty that both families experienced was socially felt at school. Karen recalls that because her clothes were handmade or hand-me-downs, she didn’t have the same types of clothing worn by the other children, and it was noticeable in her school pictures. She states,
 
>When the class picture came out…everybody had like jeans and whatever on, and here I was like, had this perfectly, I’ll call it, styled outfit…I was the only person that was, air quote, dressed up in the picture, because my mom made my clothes, and jeans were expensive, and so I didn’t have jeans like everybody else did.[^31]

Joyce, who attended school in a more affluent city than Johnstown, also recalls the class divisions felt between the children of working-class families versus middle class families particularly in relation to food. Both girls were on free or reduced lunches during several periods of their childhood.[^32] Children paid for their lunch at the front of the class or received a ticket for free or reduced lunch publicly. As a result, it was known which families qualified, and Joyce recalls the experience as “obvious” and "embarrassing."[^33]

These memories demonstrate how experiences of economic decline were not only felt privately at home, but publicly in institutions such as school. This gave the children a strong sense of class awareness and difference from an early age, which followed them through life. In the school setting, deindustrialization became tangible to children as part of their social identity, teaching them early who belonged, who struggled, and how economic instability can mark people publicly.

For both Karen and Joyce, their experiences with their families were an inspiring force for continuing their education at the university level. Joyce recalls her father directly encouraging her to go to college stating, “if I had not wanted to go, that was not an option. Like I was going to college, he was quite clear about that.”[^34] For Joyce, and her friends, their parents expressed that there was no future in Johnstown, or the industries they worked in. She describes the sentiment as, “you’re not going to stay here. Like you’re going to go get a you’re going to go to college, you’re going to go get a job somewhere else. And that was that.”[^35] For college, Joyce moved away from Johnstown to Philadelphia.

Although Karen does not recall similar motivation from her parents, she does recall similar internal motivation. In her oral history interview she states, “I think it was the expectation for myself. I don’t know, it wasn’t something my parents pushed or said I would do or whatever, but it was always my expectation for myself.”[^36]  Karen attended Indiana University and graduated with two degrees in three years. For her, college was a method of class mobility, and a mechanism to escape poverty, not a social experience. She describes it, “Some kids go to college for fun or to meet people…my job to get into college was to get there, get educated, and get out as fast as possible. So that I could not be poor.”[^37]

It is visible in Karen and Joyce’s oral histories that the circumstances of their childhoods had continuing impacts on them as adults. Joyce expresses that her closest friends in college remained people who she shared a class background with.[^38] And Karen’s perspective on education propelled her to complete hers as quickly as possible. Both girls reflect a mindset, independently or inherited, that white collar work would be more secure and more economically beneficial than blue collar work. Likewise, neither woman follows in her mother’s footsteps of staying home as a homemaker.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates that deindustrialization in Johnstown had impacts on family life far beyond the floors of the steel mill. Through the oral histories of wives and children of steelworkers it becomes clear that women’s economic and organizational labor were essential to families navigating the instability of deindustrialization. Wives as homemakers stretched household resources, managed caregiving of children and elders, and supported their husbands whose identities were tied to industrial work. At the same time, their children experienced deindustrialization as a formative and public experience in their everyday life, shaping their class awareness, educational ambitions, and understanding of class mobility.

By centering the voices of wives and children, this paper challenges narratives that do not consider labor inside the home as contributive to the family’s prospects. It also challenges narratives of deindustrialization that exclusively focus on male workers and plant closures. Oral histories provide the opportunity to analyze how industrial decline was experienced across generations and families, and the long-term sentiments it produces in people not necessarily reflected in economic data or institutional records.

# Project Methodology
### Alexis Shoulta 12/14/2025

## Introduction:
A few years ago, my mother decided that she would begin driving her parents back to their hometown of Johnstown, Pennsylvania at least once a year. They were growing older, and she wanted them to spend more time with their remaining family. During the summer of 2023, I joined them on one of these trips back. Although I had made the trip to Johnstown many times, for family reunions, funerals, and stops on road trips to Pittsburgh, I had never made the entirety of the trip alongside my grandparents. Feeling the weight of the passage of time, I was determined to not waste what might be my last opportunity to see Pennsylvania through their eyes. 

Growing up, my connection to the city of Johnstown felt more like an inherited memory than a genuine understanding. It was a place built in my mind across a kitchen table, or on the floor of my grandparents’ living room. My grandfather’s relatives are the only ones who still live there, so the limited time I did spend in Johnstown was on the periphery, up in the mountains. If I had ever had the opportunity to go into the town before that point, I couldn’t recall it. 

The Johnstown of reality, and not my borrowed memories, is a city that has lost its economic heart. Retracing my grandparents’ steps with them as they took in their home after decades of decline from the last time, they saw it was painful. The church they were married in is now closed and empty, but the house my grandmother grew up in is still there. Rather than celebrating the memories of the past, it was nearly silent in our car as we mourned them.

After we left Johnstown, the gaps in the story I knew of my family’s experiences continued to bother me. Although I had been told story after story of my family’s struggles with unemployment, poverty, and the eventual displacement that resulted from both, I had never been told the story through the lens of deindustrialization. Growing up removed from the Rust Belt, I had not realized that the scale of my family’s experiences was more than just that of one company, or town or industry. Voyages through family history, even painful history, had always been with the benefit of hindsight, and I didn’t have enough appreciation for the ways that visiting a landscape that should be familiar and finding you can’t recognize it can be traumatizing.

So, when I began my history honors capstone project, I took the opportunity to journey further into this facet of my family I did not fully understand. My project aimed to reconcile both the stories I had been told with the wider historical context they were created within. As I learned about deindustrialization, I recognized that I was more interested in the stories of people and their perceptions than the sequence of events that caused steel to leave the United States, or the statistics of people leaving the town. I decided to pursue oral history to honor the stories that my grandparents told me, as well as to find their place among the history of Johnstown.


## Why a digital archive?
In “Brownfield Public History: Arts and Heritage in the Aftermath of Deindustrialization” Stephen High, reflecting on the historical memory of deindustrialized cities asks, “Can oral and public history become a catalyst for public reflection, dialogue, and even political action?”[^38] Across the course of completing this project, I have come to believe that the answer is yes. This project pursued treating digital archiving as a form of public history practice rather than solely as a repository for digital materials. By treating the archive itself as a public-facing interpretive space, I was able to consider not only what and how stories would be preserved, but also how they would be encountered. 

Oral history is an extraordinary medium as well as an effective approach to collecting primary sources. To record an oral history is the capture of people’s memory, feelings, and life experiences in their most direct human expression. Therefore, one of my primary goals for this project was to create an oral history collection within a non-extractive and community-oriented framework. It was important to me that the primary sources I collected for my thesis would not be kept as an inaccessible resource many states away from the community they originated from. I wanted my research and collection to be accessible to every person who might be represented within it, from the people in Johnstown, to those who were displaced by its decline.

As I’ve conceptualized this project, I have thought about how I would want my creation to be used and accessed as a digital resource. Building a platform on GitHub creates new opportunities for historical synthesis of a variety of resources, and to present a multimedia study of a place and the people within it. For example, Karen Shoulta, when discussing what Johnstown looked like after the steel mill closure states, “there would be no cars in the parking lot, and they had, um, these, like, spinning gates that, um, I don't know what they're called, but they go like this, so when you walk through, they spin.”[^39] In a digital format, I can link to a photograph from the Library of Congress depicting turnstiles at a Bethlehem Steel mill in Johnstown. The digital platform gives me as the historian the ability to make easily accessible connections for viewers between primary sources held in different repositories. And this potential doesn’t have to be limited to primary sources, in the essay where I talk about secondary sources I can also directly embed links for a reader to access the source I am referencing. Additionally, because I integrated a page on my platform for publishing my methodological decision making and my historical analysis of collected materials, I can link inside my essay back to the exact records published on the archive. 

Digital platforms also create a greater opportunity for accessibility for people who have differing types of physical and financial ability. As this archive lives entirely online, it can be accessed by anybody with an internet connection. This stands in contrast to many archives that do not have digital collections or only have oral history summaries available online. As a person whose health continues to challenge their ability to travel as a historian, including with this project, this was incredibly important to me to include in my work for others. It is also why I have transcribed all the interviews and added closed captioning to all the YouTube videos of my work. Although this does not entirely remove the financial barriers of entry to history education and research, I believe that open-source digital resources have the potential to remove significant boundaries that exist within the field today.

## Building the Digital Archive
This project encouraged me to think beyond the paradigm of traditional historical research framework. For my project, constructing a digital archive functioned not only as a distribution method for original research, but as a form of methodological labor. The UI design choices for the archive serve as historical storytelling mechanisms, as well as navigational, interpretive, and organizational tools for the viewer. Working with GitHub allowed me to think as a traditional historian alongside being a builder of digital infrastructure.

I was introduced to the digital resources I would use to build this archive by Dr. Kalani Craig and Indiana University’s Initiative for Digital Arts and Humanities (IDAH). Going into this project I had experience working on the metadata cleaning of oral histories, but limited experience with creating oral histories and maintaining them in digital repositories. Additionally, I had little experience working with content management systems, GitHub, and Markdown.

To learn more about digital community archives I completed an independent reading course with Dr. Craig where I learned about ethical debates in public digital history and modern methodology for conducting community based archival work. Utilizing the Digital Arc open-source demo repository, I was able to create a custom website to keep, archive and publish my materials. To do this I forked the website on GitHub and customized its structure, metadata schema, and interface to meet my projects specific needs. To develop and manage this website I had to learn how to use Markdown based metadata, and how digital systems rendered content fields, and how to resolve code-based issues affecting how content was displayed and linked. 

Since my site has been constructed, I have completed hundreds of actions and workflow runs on the website to build a collection of fourteen records.[^40] For each record uploaded to the site I have created and modified an item file and an asset file. Each item file contains object metadata and a summary of the item. For some of the photographs, I have also included discussion transcripts between myself and the contributors discussing them. For the oral history interviews, each interview contains an interview summary, and a complete transcription. For all these items and asset files I created a name and number system for photographs and oral histories. Best practices, such as what a museum would use would have these classifications be entirely numerical, however for my project and the scale it is at I wanted to be able to identify quickly and easily who each object originated from the backend.

Other decisions and systems I had to create for my project were metadata schemes for my items. I decided that I wanted people to be able to navigate my content by decade, people and families, industry, object type, and if the story featured economic displacement. However, I used a relatively limited controlled vocabulary for the tags. I also prioritized users being able to separately sort media by type. Because the project was conceptualized to include the histories of multiple families, I included on the backend, tags for each family. If the archive grew larger, I would switch the family collection metadata to be front end, and the individual person category metadata to be back end for simplicity of use. If the project in the future expands further, I plan to include location tags as well.

## Conceptualizing Oral History
Because this project relied heavily on oral histories, it required careful consideration of how those histories could be shaped by relationships, memory, ethics, and power. Conducting interviews with family members in particular raised questions about positionality and the boundaries between lived experiences and personal analysis.

In her essay “Making Sense of Oral History,” Linda Shopes analyzes the impact of positionality on oral histories and how historians should utilize oral history in their research. She states, 
>"The questions of the interviewer, deriving from a particular frame of reference or historical interest, elicit certain responses from the narrator, deriving from that person’s frame of reference, that person’s sense of what is important or what he or she thinks is important to tell the interviewer…Oral history affords the historian a way to negotiate this paradox and perhaps helps surmount the barrier separating the analytic work of the professional historian from vernacular efforts at history-making."[^41]

For my oral history project, the positionality of my research is based on family and friend relationships. I have close relationships with my mother and my grandparents, and I am familiar with the stories they told me in the interviews. Although I am not as close with Joyce, she is my mother’s friend and she has watched me grow up, even if from afar. I believe that my relationships gave me the opportunity to get much more honest and comfortable interviews with these individuals than a person who interviewed them as a stranger. However, it also introduced its own complications into my project process. 

Sometimes when I went over to my grandparents’ house for an interview session, I would get the sense that it wasn’t a good day for an interview. It was important to me that they didn’t feel like I was only interested in spending time with them for school. So, this meant that collecting my oral histories with them took longer than I initially thought they would. Sometimes in the interviews we used family terms reflexively when recollecting or when the questions were not pre-formulated. Additionally, because my grandparents' oral histories were conducted with their granddaughter, I would often have to have them qualify statements they made that assumed knowledge of our family structure, or presumed familiarity with a concept or story. Because of these issues, I intervened in my archiving of these records more heavily than I would have with strangers. I reconciled the familiarity for the digital archive by including notes on the transcripts explaining who nicknames refer to, the relationship between the interviewer and the interviewee and adding notes to the interview summaries.

In addition to the considerations of positionality I made when conceptualizing my project, I completed an IRB to be able to carry the project out. This required me to complete online research ethics training and submit my proposed project to Indiana University for revision and approval. For the IRB I created forms for my interviewees to complete verify their participation in an academic study and release forms for publishing of their materials. I also created potential promotional samples for reviewing and submitting the structured interview questions of the semi-structured interviews I conducted. Additionally, this has modified the structure of my project to include data privacy structures such as encrypted storage practices.

## Project Participant Selection	
I have always wanted this project to be rooted in my family history, however when I originally envisioned the project it expanded further beyond them to include other people's experiences in Johnstown. My original idea was a snowball method of finding people to interview. This did happen a little bit, with my mother and her friend Joyce. There was also potential to tap into Joyce’s connections in Johnstown for interviews, and other members of my mother’s high school community, however in the end I did not pursue further interviews in Johnstown.

As I’ve learned throughout this project, collecting oral histories, processing them, and publishing them is a very time-intensive process. If I had collected on a larger scale, I originally envisioned at the length of interviews I was conducting I would have struggled to properly clean and maintain that quantity of material. 

Additionally, I believe that analyzing the experiences of two parents in contrast with the experiences of two children is a good balance for comparing the perspectives of separate generations about that time. When I knew that I was going to do fewer interviews I considered doing the fourth with my uncle and keeping the interviews entirely based on my family’s perceptions. However, that would have made the scope of the project narrower than I wanted. I think the inclusion of Joyce’s interview provides a good primary source outside context to the interviews from my family members and provides a sense of what experiences were community level versus what might be personal to my family.


## Interview Procedure
Before conducting my interviews, I reviewed both the release form and study information sheet with the interviewees to explain the interview process, how I would manage their interview, their rights as an interviewee and to establish how they wanted their materials to be collected and preserved. After reviewing these materials, if the interview was in-person I had the interviewee choose a location in their house with a comfortable chair somewhere with good lighting. If the interview was over Zoom, I verified that they were okay with the location before beginning. 

The interviews with people who were children during Deindustrialization went according to plan. I used the semi-structured format outlined in my IRB with no problems. However, for the interviews with my grandparents, I felt that the first oral history with the semi-structured format felt tense and nervous compared to our typical conversations. I believe the documentation we completed beforehand added some stress to the interview. So, I conducted a second follow up oral history later using a less structured format than the previous time. Although, I think the lack of structure gave their interviews more of a chance to go off topic, I believe that the more relaxed nature of the questions and answers provided valuable insights to the original interview. 

Additionally, before I conducted my second interview with my grandparents, I recorded discussions between us about photographs that they were contributing to the archive. I believe the format of showing them a photo and asking them to talk about it provided a primer to the interview that helped them adjust to the question-and-answer format. After receiving their permission, I integrated these discussions as transcripts alongside the photographs to provide further historical context for the events depicted.

Following the interviews I uploaded the videos from my phone to the encrypted hard drive. I then uploaded the videos to YouTube and published them as unlisted. 


## Metadata Cleaning and Archival Processing
For the oral history records, uploading the video recordings was only the beginning of the process of getting them archival ready. Each oral history was then edited in YouTube to remove gaps from the beginning and end of each interview, as well as remove personal information my grandparents said on camera. For each published video I wrote a detailed interview summary of its contents and transcribed the interview for accessibility and citation purposes. For each photographic record that had a discussion component, I also transcribed and published a transcript of the oral recording. Outside of analysis this was the most time-intensive component of my project, as each interview had to be listened to multiple times, and the combined runtime of the oral histories discussions is approximately four hours, five if the discussion recordings of the photographs are included.

For the outside citation component, I primarily included photographs from a few specific archives. For pictures of architectural structures, such as businesses and buildings in Johnstown, and architectural photographs of the steel mills I used the Library of Congress’ Historic American Engineering Record collection. For photographs of the steel industry in active production, I utilized the National Museum of Industrial History’s Bethlehem Steel Corporation Photo Collection’s Johnstown Plant subcollection. For additional photographs, I used the Pennsylvania Highlands Community College - Iron, Coal, and Steel Industry Collection hosted by the State Library of Pennsylvania’s digital POWER Library.

I selected these sources based on a few criteria. First, I wanted any resource I linked to the archive to have archival quality available metadata and structure. For this reason, I excluded photographs that I found on social media or in postcard collecting communities. Although this did prevent me from using only the only photographs I found for some concepts, and it meant the addition of outside resources was based more on institutions than direct from the community. I found those photographs to be less dependable for accuracy, especially with the growing use of AI on social media. Secondly, I wanted the photographs that I linked to the site to have the same purpose as the family photographs I archived on the site, to serve as visual contextualization for the stories being shared. Third, I wanted the photographs linked to the site to be plausibly as close to the original concept being described. If I inserted a picture of a mill, or workers they had to have been sourced from Johnstown, the highland region near Johnstown. This was also followed for any other locations I included photographs for.

Another component of the project that was time consuming was formatting the materials for the GitHub. Usually when I draft a paper or essay that requires citations, I use a citation manager. For the project, all citations and footnotes were added manually. I had to go through and format the links for Markdown, and then verify each link was embedded correctly. In general, because of the layout of the GitHub, verifying the metadata structure of each item is uniform takes time. It was also easy for me to make errors in the markdown formatting and have a citation footnote that does not render correctly. I spent a lot of time looking for these bugs and broken components when I was editing my website.


## Project Limitations and Continued Work Opportunities
 When I began working I had about four primary goals for my project. First, I wanted to collect and archive oral histories of my grandparents to better understand them, and my family. Second, I wanted to learn about and explain deindustrialization and its impacts on Johnstown, Pennsylvania as a community. Third, I wanted to create a digital archive where I could host an accessible collection of community memories such as oral histories and family photographs. Fourth, I wanted to execute a creative act of digital humanities, which implemented both the interpretive component of the history discipline and the information management component of library science. 

For the familial component of my project, I was successful in collecting and contextualizing their oral histories. I believe the oral histories collected and their accompanying images help to tell the story of my family. Referring to Stephen High, these interviews triggered important conversations among my friends and family and provided me with a better understanding of my own life experiences with them. If there was an improvement to be made in this section, I would add an oral history with my uncle, to complete the collection of perspectives from my family. I would also add more photographic materials from my family’s time in Terre Haute. 

 However, across the course of my project, it changed from fully fulfilling my original conception of what the archive would be. I originally wanted to collect a wide swath of material from people throughout Johnstown. Although I do have a perspective of from outside my family, I think to truly have a well-rounded perspective on Johnstown the archive would need more. I think that work still deserves to be done for the community, and in the future, I would like to work more with Joyce on fulfilling this component.

In building the Digital Arc component of this project, I believe I succeeded. I began working as almost a complete novice with website building. I had also never been in the position of constructing and leading an oral history project. Having completed six oral history interviews and having created an operational website where photographs and videos are accessible is an accomplishment of which I am proud. There are some improvements I would still like to make to the website. In the future I would like to restructure how metadata is visible on the front end, as well on the back end. I particularly would like to include a creation date under the authorship metadata. However, I would need to build more experience with HTML to fully customize the item pages.

Finally, I do think I succeeded in creating a project that embodies digital humanities. Although at various times my project has drifted more towards one discipline than the other, the completed project succeeds in having both interpretive and organizational components. I am especially excited about being able to connect my work with links to other resources. In the future, I would like to find even more integrative methods, I am not fully satisfied with putting an essay next to the archive. However, I think this project did a good job with my current physical and time-based constrictions as a student.


## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how digital archives and oral history can work together to preserve, interpret, and share historical experiences of deindustrialization. By centering memory, access and ethical collection practices, this archive serves not only as a research deliverable but as a form of public history engagement. Although its scale is limited, it contributes to the growing body of work on integrating digital humanities and documenting lived experiences.
