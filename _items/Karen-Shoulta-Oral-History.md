## Interview Summary
Alexis Shoulta conducted this interview on December 3, 2025.

In the interview, Tom Demko is occasionally referred to as "Pap". This is the nickname for Grandfather in the Demko/Shoulta family. 

Karen Shoulta was born in Johnstown, Pennsylvania on April 20, 1969. She lived there until there until she sixteen years old. She grew up in the moutains, with two younger siblings, Christopher and Dana. She recalls that they were often left to their own devices. They didn't have many neighbors, or children living nearby. She recalls that her family was not rich, but average. 

Her father, Thomas Demko, was a draftsman who worked for U.S. Steel in the steel mill. At home, her father took care of the outdoor chores, working on the cars and fixing up the house. While he was working, he would be gone all day.

Her mother, Ruth Demko, did not work. She stayed at home and was responsible for cooking, taking care of the house and, caring for the children. Karen's sister had Spinal Muscular Atrophy, Ruth was her primary caregiver until she died in 1981. For a time, Karen's grandmother -Ruth's mother- also lived with the family. She had Parkinson's disease, and Ruth cared for her as well.

She recalls that the roles in her family remained the same until her sister died. However, her father did help with some of the cargiving of Dana, such as giving her baths in the evening.Her parent's had a tight knit friend group. They would pool their talents, and would help work on one another's properties. They saved money by relying on their friends and not hiring outside contractors. This is how her father built the family's house. 

Karen recalls the layoffs in the steel mills. She says that they could be for economic reasons, or labor strikes. Her father was a union member, and he would not work during strikes to not cross the picket line. When he was unemployed or underemployed, he would fix up parts of their house. When she was younger, her parents would try to insulate the kids from the layoffs. However, when she got older and the steel mills started to close her father started having to commute further and futher for work. As she got older they woukld also have less things.

She says that because the family was wealthy and they never had a lot, there was never a huge decrease in what they had. However, she still recalls experiences like not having to mend the soles of her shoes because they couldn't afford to buy new ones. Her clothes were usually handmade by her mother or handmedowns from other family members. Because of this, she remembers that her clothes were never stylish, and that it would stand out in class pictures where her classmates would be wearing mass produced clothing. 

Sometimes their family would make little enough money that the kids would qualify for free or reduced lunches at school. However, when the family applied for SSI for Dana, the family had too many financial assets to qualify for the program. The family was very frugal. Her parents avoided having a mortgage or car payments.

While steel was declining in Johnstown, Karen recalls seeing the mills sit empty and become more run down when they would go into town for groceries. She recalls the flood of 1977 damaging the Bethlehem Steel plan and might have contributed to its closure. She also recalls that the mines in Johnstown that had employment issues.

When Karen was in early high school, her father eventually had to move to Terre Haute, Indiana for work. The commute was 10 hours each way. He would be gone for weeks at a time and would have to pay rent, which was further loss in income for the family. She remembers her and her brother taking on some of her father's chores when he was gone. Her father would come home on the weekends. He would work to do as many projects as he could before he left again on Sunday. 

She remembers that she didn't spend much time with people her own age outside of her siblings. They didn't go into Johnstown unless there was an essential reason to, and the didn't go to the mall to buy things because they didn't have the money. Karen worked on her Uncle's farm in the summer picking crops, baling hay and caring for the animals. They were usually paid for their work with farm goods, but occasionally on a good day they were paid a quarter. On Sundays she would go to her grandparent's house.

She recalls a few other families leaving Johnstown, but she doesn't remember a mass exodus. However, she does have the sense that the layoffs impacted lots of other families. Her own family left Johnstown to live with her father in Terre Haute when she was a junior in highschool. However, he was laid off six weeks after the rest of the family arrived in Terre Haute. He then got a job in Indianapolis, and had to commute one and a half hours to work one way. Because of this, she didn't get to spend much time with him.

Adjusting to a new high school was hard. The other kids bullied her, her new school was larger, there were less class options, and there were racial tensions in Terre Haute she hadn't previously experienced at her primarily white school in Johnstown. Her family stayed in Terre Haute until she graduated, and then moved to the Greenwood area. 

In Indianapolis, the company her father worked for changed three times in three years, but eventually the restructuring stabilized and he worked for Rolls Royce until he retired in 2003.

Karen attended Indiana University, and was the first person in her family to graduate from college. She doesn't recall her parents expecting her to go, but she said she had that expectation for herself. She didn't want the life her parents had, and she didn't want to be poor. She thought an education would give her a better life, and so she focused on getting her degrees as quickly as possible.

She currently lives in Greenwood, Indiana.
