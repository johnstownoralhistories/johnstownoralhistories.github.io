## Interview Summary
Alexis Shoulta conducted this interview on December 3, 2025.

In the interview, Tom Demko is occasionally referred to as "Pap". This is the nickname for Grandfather in the Demko/Shoulta family. 

Karen Shoulta was born in Johnstown, Pennsylvania on April 20, 1969. She lived there until there until she sixteen years old. She grew up in the moutains, with two younger siblings, Christopher and Dana. She recalls that they were often left to their own devices. They didn't have many neighbors, or children living nearby. She recalls that her family was not rich, but average. 

Her father, Thomas Demko, was a draftsman who worked for U.S. Steel in the steel mill. At home, her father took care of the outdoor chores, working on the cars and fixing up the house. While he was working, he would be gone all day.

Her mother, Ruth Demko, did not work. She stayed at home and was responsible for cooking, taking care of the house and, caring for the children. Karen's sister had Spinal Muscular Atrophy, Ruth was her primary caregiver until she died in 1981. For a time, Karen's grandmother -Ruth's mother- also lived with the family. She had Parkinson's disease, and Ruth cared for her as well.

She recalls that the roles in her family remained the same until her sister died. However, her father did help with some of the cargiving of Dana, such as giving her baths in the evening.Her parent's had a tight knit friend group. They would pool their talents, and would help work on one another's properties. They saved money by relying on their friends and not hiring outside contractors. This is how her father built the family's house. 

Karen recalls the layoffs in the steel mills. She says that they could be for economic reasons, or labor strikes. Her father was a union member, and he would not work during strikes to not cross the picket line. When he was unemployed or underemployed, he would fix up parts of their house. When she was younger, her parents would try to insulate the kids from the layoffs. However, when she got older and the steel mills started to close her father started having to commute further and futher for work. As she got older they woukld also have less things.

She says that because the family was wealthy and they never had a lot, there was never a huge decrease in what they had. However, she still recalls experiences like not having to mend the soles of her shoes because they couldn't afford to buy new ones. Her clothes were usually handmade by her mother or handmedowns from other family members. Because of this, she remembers that her clothes were never stylish, and that it would stand out in class pictures where her classmates would be wearing mass produced clothing. 

Sometimes their family would make little enough money that the kids would qualify for free or reduced lunches at school. However, when the family applied for SSI for Dana, the family had too many financial assets to qualify for the program. The family was very frugal. Her parents avoided having a mortgage or car payments.

While steel was declining in Johnstown, Karen recalls seeing the mills sit empty and become more run down when they would go into town for groceries. She recalls the flood of 1977 damaging the Bethlehem Steel plan and might have contributed to its closure. She also recalls that the mines in Johnstown that had employment issues.

When Karen was in early high school, her father eventually had to move to Terre Haute, Indiana for work. The commute was 10 hours each way. He would be gone for weeks at a time and would have to pay rent, which was further loss in income for the family. She remembers her and her brother taking on some of her father's chores when he was gone. Her father would come home on the weekends. He would work to do as many projects as he could before he left again on Sunday. 

She remembers that she didn't spend much time with people her own age outside of her siblings. They didn't go into Johnstown unless there was an essential reason to, and the didn't go to the mall to buy things because they didn't have the money. Karen worked on her Uncle's farm in the summer picking crops, baling hay and caring for the animals. They were usually paid for their work with farm goods, but occasionally on a good day they were paid a quarter. On Sundays she would go to her grandparent's house.

She recalls a few other families leaving Johnstown, but she doesn't remember a mass exodus. However, she does have the sense that the layoffs impacted lots of other families. Her own family left Johnstown to live with her father in Terre Haute when she was a junior in highschool. However, he was laid off six weeks after the rest of the family arrived in Terre Haute. He then got a job in Indianapolis, and had to commute one and a half hours to work one way. Because of this, she didn't get to spend much time with him.

Adjusting to a new high school was hard. The other kids bullied her, her new school was larger, there were less class options, and there were racial tensions in Terre Haute she hadn't previously experienced at her primarily white school in Johnstown. Her family stayed in Terre Haute until she graduated, and then moved to the Greenwood area. 

In Indianapolis, the company her father worked for changed three times in three years, but eventually the restructuring stabilized and he worked for Rolls Royce until he retired in 2003.

Karen attended Indiana University, and was the first person in her family to graduate from college. She doesn't recall her parents expecting her to go, but she said she had that expectation for herself. She didn't want the life her parents had, and she didn't want to be poor. She thought an education would give her a better life, and so she focused on getting her degrees as quickly as possible.

She currently lives in Greenwood, Indiana.

(0:00 - 0:30)

Alexis Shoulta: Hello!

Karen Shoulta: Hello

Alexis: What's your name? 

Karen: Karen Shoulta 

Alexis: And what's your relationship to me?
 
Karen: I'm Alexis Katarina Shoulta's mother. 

Alexis: And?

Karen: I am the daughter of Tom and Ruth Demko, former residents of Johnstown, Pennsylvania. 

Alexis: It's December 3rd and I, Alexis Shoulta, am conducting an interview with Karen Shoulta, my mother. Thank you for being willing to share your experience with me today.

(0:30 - 1:11)
Alexis: As I previously mentioned, this study aims to collect oral histories and recollections of deindustrialization in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. I am studying the impact of changes in the work environment on families and people's life experiences. Our interview today should last approximately an hour. 

I'm going to ask you a series of questions about your family and experiences with steel in Johnstown. This interview is being recorded for oral history preservation and historical analysis purposes. If you need to take a break at any time, let me know and I can pause the recording and interview. 

We'll go back over your consent form at the end of the interview to review and confirm previous choices. 

So where and when were you born?

Karen: I was born in Johnstown, Pennsylvania on April 20th, 1969. 

Alexis: Where do you currently live? 

Karen: Greenwood, Indiana.

(1:12 - 2:22)
Alexis: What is your connection with Johnstown? 

Karen: It's the city I was born in and I lived there until I was, had just turned, we left after I was 16 years old. 

Alexis: And then what was your family's connection to the steel industry?

Karen: My father worked for U.S. Steel as a draftsman in the Johnstown plant. 

Alexis: Can you tell me something about your family history? 

Karen: So my family history is both of my parents were from Pennsylvania. They met in Pennsylvania and they got married when they were 26 and 28. 

About a year later, a little over a year later after they got married, they had me. Followed two years and two days by my brother. And then we had a sister born three years after that. Also within five.

My mother did not work. My sister had a disease called SMA, which is spinal muscular atrophy. 

Most people would understand it if they understand Lou Gehrig's disease. So my mother did not work. She took care of my sister, and my father worked in the steel mills.

(2:22 - 5:31)
Karen: At times there were periods of layoffs in the steel mills. Sometimes it was related economically. Sometimes it was if there was a strike by the actual operators that worked in the steel mill, then my father, who worked at an office job, would not cross the picket line because that was usually had unfavorable consequences. 

Alexis: Can you tell me what your family was like when your father was employed and working in the steel industry before any major industry layoffs? 

Karen: So to the best of my knowledge, because I was younger, we lived in the top of the Laurel Mountains. We had a home that we lived in, probably a little bit different than some kids' life. We did not have a lot of neighbors because we lived in the country out in the mountain. 

My dad went to work every day and came home. That's sort of my generic memory of it. We were not rich by any means whatsoever. 

We were just probably kind of like an average family and we had extended family that lived around us. 

Alexis: I guess during this time, what were the assigned work roles between your mother and your father in the family? 

Karen: So as I said, my sister had a deadly disease, so my mom took care of her and my brother and I. She did, of course, the housework, etc. There was a period of time when I was younger that my mom's mom also lived with us and she had Parkinson's disease, so my mom was taking care of her mother and my sister at the same time. 

My dad would go to work. On the weekends, then he had, I'll call it more the outdoor chores, fixing things on the car, fixing things on the house. They had a nice friend group where if somebody was talented at one thing, then they would all go and work on that person's house for whatever that item was. 
Then if something else needed work done on somebody else's house and they had a talent, that helped them to be able to save money not to hire people out and they helped each other with things they needed done. 

Alexis: Then as parents, what were their roles to each of you as parental figures?

Karen: I would say probably what was a typical 70s family. My mom was home with us all day when we didn't go to school. Then when we were old enough to go to school, obviously we went to school all day. So I don't really know, she was there with my sister. My sister did have a teacher from the school system that would come in several days a week and teach my sister. 

My dad, of course, was gone all day to work, but then he would come home. My mom would make dinner. I'm sure there was homework. I don't really remember a lot of that, but I'm sure there was some homework that needed to be done, etc. Bath time and going to bed during the work week. During the weekends, we just played outside a lot.

(5:31 - 6:05)
Karen: I guess to our own devices, to a degree, there being living in the forest, there was lots of places to explore and be at. There weren't kids that really lived around us. We didn't have like what some kids grew up where they play with friends. 

We didn't really have that and we lived far away from where we went to school. My parents didn't drive us to somebody's house to play. If something like that was done, it was usually like a special occasion like it was somebody's birthday, but those weren't everyday occurrences.

(6:06 - 6:50)
Alexis: Were you close with your parents? 

Karen: I don't know. I mean, I guess so. I mean, I don't remember doing family game time or anything like that. 

That wasn't really the way things were back then. We had TV, but being where we lived, most of the time you could see TV would be what I call the winter months when the leaves were off the trees. Therefore, sometimes you could get a station from Pittsburgh or from the closest town we lived to, Johnstown, but the TV wasn't even what I'd say was a reliable thing to do because you didn't get TV all year.

(6:50 - 13:53)
ALexis: And then earlier you mentioned Pap [Tom] lost his job sometimes due to layoffs, financial layoffs or other strikes. Do you remember any of them in particular? 

Karen: I guess I just sort of remember more where he would have been around the house. Of course, during the day he would take on more house projects, things on his to-do list to do. 

Now, of course, you can't do some jobs if you have to put a lot of money in residing the house or something like that, but he always seemed to have jobs to do, or my grandfather didn't live very far away. Sometimes he would help him do things and vice versa, back and forth. So that's sort of, I guess, my recollection of life being different. 

The only thing I remember at one point in time, and I don't know if it happened more than once, was we must have made so little money that we did get. It was either free or reduced lunches. It used to be in school, like when they took the head count in the morning, you paid for lunch, or they gave you like a little, it was probably like two inches by two inches, the mimeograph, the white with the purple that used to like smell really cool after it came off the mimeograph machine. 

You were handed one of those. So I know at one point we got free or reduced lunches, but that's that. I mean, we were never wealthy. We didn't have a lot, so it's not like there was a huge decrease in what we had. 

The one thing I do remember, we had these little sneakers and they would kind of be like the canvas keds now, but they weren't keds, and we called them bobos. And I do remember when, at some point when my bobos, the insoles wore out, my dad traced my foot like on a piece of cardboard or a thicker, you know, bendable, not paper, but something thicker than paper, and he traced my foot and he cut it out and he slid it in my bobos because there wasn't money to buy new shoes. So that was how I kept using my bobos. 

Alexis: And so getting free and reduced lunch at school was public, like people, other people would know? 

Karen: Yes, it was done at the front of class, yeah. Just like they handed out at that point in time, whether you got fluoride pills or not, that was the same way. It was all done at the front of class, like at the beginning of the day. 

Alexis: Was there social ramifications? 

Karen: Well, I wouldn't necessarily say there's social ramifications, but you know, my parents never never had a lot of money, so I'm the oldest child of three and I wore hand-me-downs. In fact, my parents, with this friend group they had, a lot of times clothes got passed from family to family, depending on who who could use clothes. 

My clothes actually came from somebody in Pittsburgh that an aunt of mine knew that had a, they only had one daughter, so I had her clothes to wear. But yeah, I mean, never had stylish clothes or anything like that. One of the class pictures that was done, my mom used to make my clothes to save money, and I remember my mom making some comment when she, when the class picture came out and she looked at it, and everybody had like jeans and whatever on, and here I was like, had this perfectly, I'll call it, styled outfit. 

It was the polyester of the time, and she had made my shirt, and it had a solid red, and then a print that was navy blue and red, and then the pants, I think, were the print, so it kind of like all matched, but I was the only person that was, air quote, dressed up in the picture, because my mom made my clothes, and jeans were expensive, and so I didn't have jeans like everybody else did. 

Alexis: Um, do you remember how your family, outside of what you shared, do you remember how your family responded to the layoffs? Like, was it like, did you know when your dad, like it would, it would happen, or do you, did things like change in how you spent money, or how you guys? 

Karen: Um, I would say like, when we were younger, our parents, probably like most parents, tried to insulate us from any, you know, understanding any of that. But you know, through the years, as I got older, and I was actually in, you know, probably junior high, and then in high school, my father got laid off again, and at that point, the steel mill started closing, and he took a position outside of Pittsburgh, and he would travel back and forth every day, and it was probably a good, probably an hour and a half drive each way. So obviously, he was gone more, um, so as I got older, obviously, then yes, there, there were less and less things, or there was cutbacks, and then he was laid off from that job when that company closed, and then he moved to Terre Haute, Indiana, and took a job, and that was when I was a freshman or sophomore in high school. So then he was traveling every week, 10 hours each way from Johnstown to Terre Haute. And yes, of course, now then, my parents, it wasn't, you know, now it wasn't just him traveling, but they had to rent him a place to stay in during the week, so that was an extra expense for them. So yes, I was aware that, you know, we were already not well off and, you know, had less things. 

Alexis: Did you notice at school other students having experiences with their family being laid off? Did you notice, like, a change in the community? 

Karen: Um, I, I don't know that I can say that, because I was never part of the 'it' crowd, because I, I didn't have things.  My parents were too poor, um, you know, never had stylish clothes or whatever, so probably I would have to guess that the people that I hung around with were of similar economic circumstances. So we didn't really have a lot to begin with. Um, so I, I guess I would probably say no, probably because of the people that I hung out with that were my friends. 

Alexis: And I guess you guys probably didn't go down to town very often, but did you notice changes in Johnstown as a town during this time period? 

Karen: I guess to the degree of, I mean, when we went, if we went into town to get groceries, we did go by some of the steel mills. So, um, yes, obviously, there would be no cars in the parking lot, and they had, um, these, like, [spinning gates](https://www.loc.gov/item/pa3035/) that, um, I don't know what they're called, but they go like this, so when you walk through, they spin.[^1] Obviously, you know, there were no cars parked around, and people weren't walking in that area anymore. Um, and then things kind of looked, I guess I would say, tarnished isn't the right word, but when you don't use something, then it loses its sparkle, and it just, you know, it's not upkept usually.

(13:57 - 17:29)
Karen: Also contributing to this was the Johnstown flood, which occurred in 1977, um, down in the valley. We lived up again in the mountains, down in the valley, that was where the flood, um, occurred, so I can specifically, in my mind, see Bethlehem Steel, not where my dad worked. He worked at U.S. Steel, but I could see Bethlehem Steel. That plant was, um, I guess I would say greatly damaged, and to be honest, I'm not sure that that plant ever came back. I would have to look at the timing on that, but that could have been also a contributing factor to what, you know, to what happened.

Alexis: Um, and the family, uh, ended up leaving eventually, but do you recall other people leaving town to go find, like their families leaving for other work opportunities, like people moving away?

Karen: Um, there were a couple kids from my class that left. I remember one moved to Macon, Georgia. I have no idea why I remember that, um, and there was one other family that left as, as well.

I can't remember where my classmates that left. I can't remember where they went, but, um, no, I mean, I guess, no, not really. I don't remember, like a mass exodus or anything like that.

Alexis: And then during this period when steel was declining and work was uncertain, did you notice any change in your family roles, or did they stay consistent? 

Karen: I would say they were fairly consistent. My sister died in 1981, may of 81, so the roles definitely stayed until that, that point in time the same, because my mother was the primary caregiver. Um, I do remember my dad in the evenings, though, helping with my sister, giving her a bath and whatnot.

Um, so after that, so by the time, you know, my sister would have died in 81, I would have been 12, um, and obviously my brother and I were in school, so there wasn't so much, like, you know, there wasn't a child at home that needed help, and at that point, uh, my grandmother was already, she had moved to a nursing home, and then she died, so my mom didn't have her to care for. So, um, I don't know that the roles changed, but I believe my mother's role changed. She didn't have as many people that she was caring for, and my brother and I were growing older and didn't need, um, you know, as much as attention as a small child that needs diapers changed and things like that.

Alexis: Did you guys receive any support for dealing with your sister's death? 

Karen: Um, no. My parents, I do not believe, ever, um, received support. Um, they had two cars, one for my dad to go to work and one for my mom to have to, you know, do housewife type things, and also to take my sister to her doctor appointments, and I recall my mother saying that they were told when they applied for assistance to help with my sister, they were informed that they would have to get rid of one of the cars before they would qualify for any kind of aid, um, but the problem with that is my dad needed a car for interviews, and my mom needed a car for appointments for my sister, so it did not make sense to sell a car when, you know, there would be the potential my dad would have an interview or get a job, and my sister would need to go to the hospital or, um, go to a doctor's appointment, so no, there was no assistance from what I understand.

(17:29 - 22:55)
Alexis: Did you get any, did you, were you, did you and your brother, did anybody, like, talk to you? Did you get, like, any emotional support after Dana passed away, or were you just expected to continue going to school? 

Karen: Um, I don't really, I don't really remember. I can't really tell you, sorry. 

Alexis: That's fine. And so, how did you learn that your family was going to move to Terre Haute, do you remember? 

Karen: Um, not exactly. I mean, my dad was working in Monroeville, which is outside of Pittsburgh. He lost that job.

Um, I do know at some point in time, I think it was before that job, my parents took a trip, two trips. It was two trips. One was to Florida to look for a job in the Orlando area, and the other one was to Texas to the Beaumont area. U.S. Steel, I think, had a plant there at that time. My dad was trying to get rehired by them, but neither of those worked out. Um, so, as for, my dad worked, he worked for J.I. Case in Terre Haute.

He was working there as a contractor. So, I don't know how I was exactly told, but he did that for basically a year, and I was getting, that would have been my sophomore year of high school, and they decided that, you know, they wanted me to have a little bit of stability because I'd been in the same school system the whole time up to 10th grade. So, they elected to, um, move to Terre Haute so that I could finish out high school at the same place for two years.

Um, so, we moved, and six weeks after we moved, then my dad got, um, was, you know, got laid off. He was just a contractor at J.I. Case in Terre Haute. So, there we had, they had moved the whole family, and now my dad didn't have a job again.

Alexis: Um, sorry, I want to jump back a little bit really quickly. Do you remember what it was like at home when your dad would be away for long periods of time? 

Karen: I mean, yeah. My mom was, had to do, like, literally everything.

Sometimes that meant us kids did things. We had a dog. Um, back then, people didn't have dogs in their houses.

They were outside, and we had a dog outside. And so, my brother and I had to take care of, you know, take care of the dog. That was sort of my dad's job.

So, my brother and I had, you know, took that over. Um, you know, I mean, otherwise, it would have just been my mom and my brother and I. I don't remember a whole lot of other things that that changed. I'm guessing probably, um, well, I don't even know that.

I'd say my brother might have helped with long work, but my dad came home on the weekends. He would work all day on Friday, and then do a 10-hour drive after he had worked all day, and he would get home in, you know, the middle of the next morning, night, however you want to look at it, and then he would leave Sunday. So, he was trying to get everything done in, like, a day before he had to turn around and do a 10-hour drive to go back.

Alexis: Yeah, like, what would, I guess I'd say, what would it be like on the weekends when he was home? 

Karen: I mean, our life was pretty, I don't know, I guess I'll say generic. Um, we always went to church on Sunday, so there was church. Um, but, you know, my life was very, I would say, very much the same my whole life because, again, we didn't, we didn't go play with other people or go to the mall or anything like that.

Like, my life was pretty much the, just very boring and very much the, very much the same. It didn't really matter how old or young I was. There, there weren't kids that lived near us. My brother and I did go work on my uncle's farm. 

Um, so we, you know, we would do that in the summer. We would, um, bale hay. We would pick corn. We would pick potatoes. Um, probably me more than my brother. I would go down to the barn. I would brush the cows out. I would feed the cows. We didn't really mess with the chickens much. Um, but, you know, my, my life for those 16 years was pretty much always this, the same. 

There wasn't, you know, we didn't live in a neighborhood. My parents didn't drive us places. Um, the city of Johnstown to, like, go to the mall up in Richland and things like that, you know, that was probably 30, 35 minute drive and, you know, my parents didn't really have money, so they didn't just go to the mall to shop. So we didn't go to the mall.

Alexis: Did you get paid for your farm work? Um, so if it was a good day my uncle gave us, like, a quarter. Um, normally we got sent home with potatoes, corn, chicken, beef.

Um, so, no, not usually money. Green beans. I think we picked green beans, too.

So, no, it was normally some kind of food for the family versus any kind of money. 

Alexis: And that was, was that for compensation for your work or was it because, like, the family was supporting you guys? 

Karen: Um, I don't know. I think it was just how my uncle Robbie was.

(22:35 - 24:01)
Karen: I don't, you know, everybody left with something and it would be, like, um, my uncle, my, so it was across the street from us was my great-aunt and then my grandfather lived next to her and then the other brother lived, the three all lived in a row. Um, not really close, like, people, like, live now. I mean, not terribly far either, but, um, you know, everybody that came and helped with baling hay or whatever, they usually left with something, so.

Alexis: Um, and did you recall, like, the rest of the family ever helping out while Pap wasn't employed? 

Karen: Um, I would, I mean, I wouldn't really say a lot that I was aware of. Um, my parents built their own, my dad and his friends built that house, so they built it as they could afford it, so there wasn't, like, a mortgage that had to be paid. Um, my parents were very frugal.

Um, they bought cars, so there were no things on payment, so when my dad lost his job, basically, you know, they had to figure out, like, food and health care and things like that. Um, so I don't, I wouldn't say that nobody ever helped, but, um, not like now, like, food pantries or, you know, anything like that. Um, no, not that I'm aware of.

(24:01 - 26:16)
Alexis: Um, and I guess when your dad would come home on the weekends, did you get to spend time with him? 

Karen: Um, yeah, we would go to church, um, but, you know, if there were things that need fixed around the house or, like, if it was the summer and I don't know if my brother was doing the lawn or not, then, I mean, he had his chores that he normally did all week. He was trying to clean those in a day and a half, so I wouldn't really say that we spent time together. Um, growing up, we did go on Sundays down to my grandfather's house, um, well, my grandparents' house a lot, um, for a couple hours, and usually my dad's sister, and sometimes, uh, my dad's sister and her husband, sometimes their girls would come.

So, I mean, I guess there was some, like, family time, but I wouldn't necessarily say it was with my dad or my parents because usually the adults were together and then the cousins were together, and again, we spent a lot of time outside. 

Alexis: And then, sorry to jump back to where we were before, but after you guys went to Terre Haute, you kind of talked about Pap going to work. He worked at J.I. Case. Um, after that job, where did he, what did he do? 

Karen: Um, so he got laid off from that job, and then he got a job at Rolls-Royce. At that point, it was Allison Engine Company in Indianapolis. So, again, then every day he was driving, like, an hour and 15, hour and 30 minutes, you know, two ways, driving to work, working all day, and then coming back.

So, you know, again, there wasn't really a lot of time with him because, you know, he had long days. 

Alexis: Um, and what was it like for you to switch high schools moving to Terre Haute? 

Karen: Oh, that was pretty brutal. Um, girls are very mean.

Junior year of high school is not really a great time to move from one school to another. 

Alexis: Was it culturally different than Pennsylvania? 

Karen: Um, I ran cross-country. I've always done a lot of sports, um, found good camaraderie in that, and I started running cross-country in Terre Haute, and before school even started, one of the girls on the cross-country team, uh, decided she didn't like me for whatever reason.

And so, before school even started, I had people that didn't like me, and school hadn't even started, um, because she talked to people. Culturally, it was different. I went to a larger high school.

(26:16 - 30:54)
Karen: Um, there were, uh, so where I went to high school, I only ever recall one Black person. It was a young man, and we had the juvenile detention in, uh, the city where my high school was, and, um, so he was in juvenile detention for whatever reason. He came to school, which now I don't think that that goes together, but it did then, and so he was like the cool kid even though he was from juvie because he could break dance and do all this stuff.

Um, so he was very cool. When I got to Terre Haute, I'm not sure what the percentage would be. If I had to guess, I'd say maybe it was one-third Black and two-thirds White, and so, you know, here I come from a school where we only had one Black kid, and he was the cool kid, and, you know, there it was, um, the Blacks and the Whites didn't intermix a lot.

I did have Black friends, but I don't, I wouldn't see it as, um, as racially harmonious where, like I said, Pennsylvania, the kid from juvie was the cool kid. 

Alexis: So it was like, it was people, they didn't get along? It was like, uh, it was like racism? 

Karen: I don't know. I just, there were, like, I didn't care who my friends were.

Um, when I was in high school there, we had an Italian exchange student and a Finnish exchange student, um, and I don't remember any exchange students in Pennsylvania, so I just, like, never had bounds of who my friends were. I didn't, you know, I didn't care. Um, I ended up being really good friends with the girl from Finland.

We still keep in, um, contact, not a lot, but, um, but I had Black friends in Pennsylvania, or, I'm sorry, not Pennsylvania, in Terre Haute. I just don't know that that was something that, people did it, it just wasn't as much. It was probably more people stayed friends along racial lines, if I kind of had to ad-lib it.

Alexis: Um, and then you graduated in Terre Haute.

Karen: Yep. 

Alexis: Um, I had another question. Do you recall Pap's, like, uh, work ever stabilizing, or was it inconsistent for the rest of his career? 

Karen: Um, so he, so that, that kind of took you to trail to Rolls-Royce, so they let me stay and graduate, so I spent two years there. Then my parents, um, moved to the Greenwood area, and my dad had a job at Rolls-Royce. Um, he, he did retire from Rolls-Royce, so he had stability from 19, he, he probably started there in 86, and he retired in 2003.  And it did, it did, it did change jobs. I mean, it was, I think at one point, it was three companies in three years. It was Allison Engine Company, then I think it was just Allison, or, sorry, I think it was Allison, then it was Allison Engine Company, and then it was Rolls-Royce, so there was some stress for him there with all those corporate changes over the years, but, um, he did, you know, he did stay. 

Alexis: What was the move to Greenwood like for you? 

Karen: It was kind of a non-event.

Um, I remember the house my parents bought had a ton of wallpaper, my mom didn't like it, and it was probably, they bought the house, but didn't live in, in it for maybe two or three months, because they wanted to let me finish high school, but I do remember, I think it was like April or May, they brought me over one weekend, and I just stripped wallpaper. They left me at the house, and I think about this now by myself, there was no phone or anything, and they went back to Terre Haute, and all I did was strip wallpaper all weekend.  And then, you know, I graduated from high school there, um, but then I went to college in August, so I, you know, it was kind of a non-event for me. It's not like I had high school friends in Greenwood, or even really made friends, because, um, you know, we moved, we moved, I think that was the summer I got my, um, wisdom teeth out, um, and I started college, so I honestly don't even think I worked that summer, so I never really have had air quotes 'Greenwood friends' from like that period in my life.

Alexis: Were you the first in your family to go to college? 

Karen: I was the first in my, well, my dad started college, but he never finished it, so I'm the first person in my family to finish college.

Alexis: Was it always the expectation you were going to college? 

Karen: I think it was the expectation for myself. I don't know, it wasn't something my parents pushed or said I would do or whatever, but it was always my expectation for myself.

(31:15 - 31:59)
Alexis: Where did the expectation for yourself come from? 

Karen: I didn't want to be poor. I didn't want to, I didn't want to have the life my parents had. I wanted to do better, and not that they did bad, but I felt like if I had an education, then I could do better.

Alexis: Did they help you with the steps? Like, it takes steps to get into college. Like, you have to apply to take the SAT. Did they help you with those, or did you have to figure it out on your own? 

Karen: Figure it out on my own.

Alexis: How? 

Karen: I don't know, like, I honestly don't even ever remember studying. I don't remember studying for the SAT. I don't know if that was a thing back then, so I know I took it the first time, and I was trying to get into IU in the honors program, and I was short something like, I don't know, 10 points that I needed, and so my parents paid for me to take the SAT a second time, and I actually scored less points than the first time, so I didn't take it again.


(31:59 - 34:46)
Karen: My parents may have helped me, but to be honest, I don't remember them helping me, but I don't really remember what you did to apply. I'm sure it's quite different now than it was. At that point, you know, people pretty much went to college wherever they lived.

It wasn't like now. People apply, you know, 10 different places all across the country, so it was kind of a no-brainer. My parents had me apply, wanted me, wanted me and I don't think I did it, to apply to Indiana State, and I said I had no interest in going back to Terre Haute. So to be honest, I only probably applied at IU, and that was it, and I had good grades, so I got in.

Plus, it also, like I said, it wasn't the institution it is today, and people didn't travel out of state as much to go to school, so it wasn't like a difficult thing. 

Alexis: Did you feel like in high school and in college that your background was similar to other people's or it was different?

Karen: So for high school, I would say different in some senses that we were not as well off. In Terre Haute or in Johnstown? In Johnstown.

In Terre Haute, my dad had a more steady job, so not so much that. I was probably different in the sense that, you know, like I said, I didn't have a problem having Black friends. I didn't have a problem being friends with the exchange students, so I think it wasn't maybe. Maybe it was different just because who I was, and I wanted to see the bigger world, and I didn't put limits on myself. 

Alexis: Do you, so do you know where that like spark to see the bigger world came from? Like was it books or television?

Karen: Never really watched TV. 

Alexis: Was it your dad? 

Karen: My mom, that was her favorite punishment when you did something wrong, when your TV privileges got taken away, so I can't really say it came from TV.

Alexis: Because I know Pap traveled a lot in the military. 

Karen: He did, and I don't know that that's it because he never really told a lot of stories about where he traveled. I just knew that the world was bigger.

In fact, I do remember this. It was either my freshman or sophomore year in high school, and we were all in the auditorium, and I don't know why the coroner came to talk to us about something. And I remember him saying, look to your left and look to your right, and then he said something along the lines of like, I don't know, X amount of you are going marry somebody sitting in this auditorium or something. I was like, yeah, not me.

(34:47 - 36:50)
Karen: So maybe that was the impetus that I was going to see something else or do something else or be something else, but I definitely wasn't TV, and I like to read but not travel books, so I wouldn't say that any of that came from that. It was just, I don't know, a natural curiosity, I guess. 

Alexis: Did you feel like you had challenges in college being a first-generation student?

Karen: I don't know. I just worked my hiney off. I mean, literally, I had a job. I think I had a job the first week I was in school or the second week.

I had a job, and I knew I had to study and get good grades, and that was pretty much it. Some kids go to college for fun or to meet people or they used to say to get your MRS degree. My job to get into college was to get there, get educated, and get out as fast as possible. So that I could not be poor, and I graduated college with two degrees in three and a partial years. I did it in less than four years. 

Alexis: What were your degrees? 

Karen: I have a bachelor's degree in distribution management, now known as supply chain, and a bachelor's degree in marketing, both from what is now the Kelley School of Business at IU. 

Alexis: Is there anything I didn't ask you about that you feel was important to this time period or this topic in your life? 

Karen: No, the only other thing I can kind of add, you're talking about steel mills, there also was, you know, the mines were really big in that part of Pennsylvania as well.

(36:32 - 41:05)
Karen: And I think they also, tying into the the fabric of Johnstown, I do think, you know, the mines had some of their challenges. I don't think that they had as many layoffs, but I do think some of that probably occurred at the same time, so there probably were multiple, and maybe that's why I didn't feel so, you know, isolated in the sense like this only happened to my family. It was happening to lots of families.

Alexis: Was it something people ever talked about, like the mills or the coal and the economy or job loss? 

Karen: Not that I really remember. It might have been like an adult discussion, but it certainly wasn't something with kids we talked about. 

Alexis: Did you, so you guys never talked about like your parents losing your jobs? 

Karen: No, not that I recall, no.

Alexis: Do you think, so it wasn't, was it like normal to have people's like fathers going away for work? 

Karen: I would say no. I would say a lot of people just stayed until like the layoff was over, the strike was over. I mean, you know, when you talk about talking to people, I mean, so, you know, my life really was when I went to school, I saw people at school, but then I never really saw them again.

Like, you know, there weren't homework studies, you didn't go to people's houses, didn't really talk on the phone, so it's not like I had friends or friendships. I guess it's a weird way to put it, but, you know, and for my parents' friends, nobody had a girl that was my age. So even when the families, you know, like I said, my dad, my parents' friends would get together and help each other when they would get together and they would like, you know, have an evening and the parents, they all played canasta, they played cards, and us kids all played together, like there was nobody my age.

There was no girls, there were some boys older or younger than me, so it's not like I really had friends to talk to things about when I was growing up, it was, you know.

Alexis: Is that something you thought you think changed when you moved to Terre Haute, because you weren't out in the mountain anymore? 

Karen: I would say it changed, but also I was older, so I was able to drive, which then meant, you know, I didn't really have a lot of friends only being there two years, girls kind of had their friend group by then. There was another girl that was in my subdivision that ended up making friends with, so I could like walk to her house, but, you know, the car gave me mobility to get a job then, so then I could drive to work, and then, you know, I played.

I only did cross country, I didn't end up doing track and field that I normally did because it was the same coach and some of the same people from cross country, so I quit running after that. I picked up tennis, I hadn't played tennis, and I can't remember if I played volleyball there or not. I played volleyball in Pennsylvania, so I did have some more friendships, but not a lot just because I didn't go to school there very long.

It was only, you know, two years. 

Alexis: I have another question. I lost it for a second. Sorry.

Karen: It's alright, and even at that, when I transferred, I already had my classes for my junior year from Pennsylvania, and so we went, my parents went, my mom went with me to register for high school in Terre Haute, and we had my class schedule. They didn't even offer some of the classes I had, which is kind of interesting if you think you're going from a smaller rural school to a larger school system.

You know, I do remember the lady, the guidance counselor, or the secretary, or whatever, going like, huh, you're the second person from Pennsylvania this week or this, that we've had transferred in recently, and we don't have, we don't know what to do with you. You have classes that are beyond what we have, so I did take two classes through Indiana State University, and I think that it was a boy, and I don't ever know who he was, but they sent him to Rose-Hulman to take some classes, which was kind of interesting. 

Alexis: Did you, when you worked, did you get to keep all of your money, or did any of it go back to the family? 

Karen: When I worked in high school, as far as I remember, I kept it all.

Alexis: Okay. Thank you for talking to me today. You're welcome.

Karen: Have a good day. You too.
