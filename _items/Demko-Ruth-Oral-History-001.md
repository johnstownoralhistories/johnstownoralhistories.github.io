## Interview Summary
This interview was collected by Alexis Shoulta on October 5, 2025.

Ruth Demko née Connall was born June 1st, 1940, in Youngstown, Ohio. She moved to as a toddler Johnstown in 1942 and lived there until 1985 or 1986. Her mother was originally from Johnstown, Pennsylvania, and her father was from Wheeling, West Virgina. They lived in one house with her mother's family -both of her grandparents, her aunt, and her great aunt- for about three years. Her younger sister was born shortly after they moved. 

Her husband worked in the steel industry from before they got married until he was laid off in the 1980s. When they first got married, she says life was easy, and because they weren't extravagant, they had enough money. Her husband was the breadwinner and she was the homemaker. She stayed at home and cared for their three children. On the mountain with them, Tom's father, his uncle, and the man that lived up the road all worked in steel. However, she said there was a difference between being laid off as an office worker or a laborer on the floor.

While her husband was laid off from the steel mills, he would build their house. He would also go weekly to sign up for unemployment. She recalls that he was around the house more and was able to help her more in the care of her third child Dana, who had Spinal Muscular Atrophy. As a result of the illness, Dana's muscles were atrophying and she needed full-time assistance. She could not sit up by herself or walk. While Tom wasn't working, he would get up in the morning to take care of Dana, giving Ruth the opportunity to sleep in that she didn't normally have. He also helped Ruth with Dana's mobility. During his longest layoff, he didn't work for 15 months.

Ruth recalls the layoffs as uncomfortable. They had to be careful with their spending on food and had to watch their money to afford their bills. She managed the money in the family, so she made the decisions for where to cut. She mentions that food was an easy place to cut back. She describes that they wouldn't buy snacks such as potato chips and ice cream. She would buy chicken and find ways to spread it three ways across meals. She says that they also ate a lot of pasta. At one point the family received butter and a block of cheese from the government. For different periods of time the family's income was low enough to qualify for reduced prices or free lunches at school.

On the topic of the steel industry, Ruth recalls that the mills closed and people left town. However, she recalls one couple that received a job opportunity in Texas through family but refused to leave. Her family decided to go where they could find a job. Tom moved separately from the family to Terre Haute, Indiana for work for a year. He only returned on the weekends every three weeks. She recalls one of Tom's coworkers who also ended up commuting, she doesn't recall that commuting was common. She says generally people either stayed together or moved together. She recalls one steelworker who was laid off from the company a few months before he would have qualified for retirement. She says his wife went out and started cleaning homes.

Ruth recalls that it was difficult for her to parent without the support of her husband. It was important to her to not substitute her son, Christopher, as the man of the house because he was a young boy. She wanted to preserve his childhood. However, there were some jobs she had to give him to do because she could physically not do them. For example, she had him haul 40-pound bags of salt for the water softener and get it loaded. It was also difficult having to deal with the school by herself on behalf of their children. In one case she dealt with a teacher who treated her daughter Karen poorly because she fell out with his son. Another case she felt was challenging handling by herself was when her daughter wanted to date an older boy. She found the lack of having her husband to support her in these situations hard. When she was going to church by herself, one time a lady asked her if Tom's cancer had come back because he wasn't there. Once one of her children asked her if she was going to the leave with Tom to go to Terre Haute too.

The rest of the family followed a year later in 1985. Ruth arranged the move by herself. Her friends came to help her pack, but she felt she did not have support outside of her friends in making the move. Because her mother had moved for her father's job, it didn't feel foreign to Ruth that her family might have to do the same.

Shortly after the family was reunited in Terre Haute, Tom was laid off again. He got a job working in Indianapolis and he commuted daily. They rented their house in Terre Haute. They were offered a good price to buy it. However, they didn't. They only stayed in Terre Haute until their oldest child, Karen, graduated high school. She says Tom couldn't take the drive anymore because it was too exhausting. He would come home, eat dinner, and then go to bed. However, she says that was much better than not seeing him for weeks at a time while they were living apart.

Alexis Shoulta: Thank you for being willing to share your experiences with me today. As I previously mentioned, the study aims to collect oral histories and recollections of deindustrialization in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. I'm studying the impact of changes in the work environment on families and people's life experiences.

(0:15 - 0:26)
Alexis: Our interview today should last approximately an hour. I'm going to ask you a series of questions about your family and experiences with steel in Johnstown. This interview is being recorded for oral history preservation and historical analysis purposes.

(0:27 - 0:40)
Alexis: If you need to take a break at any time, let me know and I can pause the recording and interview. We'll go back over your consent form at the end of the interview to record and confirm your previous choices. This is Alexa Shoulta interviewing her grandmother, Ruth Demko, on October 5th, 2025.

(0:41 - 0:55)
Alexis: Hi, Ruth. 

Ruth: Hi, Lexie. 

Alexis: Where and when were you born? 

Ruth: I was born in Youngstown, Ohio, June 1st, 1940, in [St. Elizabeth Hospital](https://digital.lib.ecu.edu/24504).[^1]

(0:55 - 1:29)
Alexis: And where do you currently live? 

Ruth: [address removed] Greenwood, Indiana. 

Alexis: What is your connection to Johnstown, Pennsylvania? 

Ruth: I lived there from nineteen, I guess it started in 1942 to 1985, five, four, six. 1985, I think it was.

(1:30 - 2:07)
Alexis: And why did you move to Johnstown? 

Ruth: Move to? 

Alexis: Mm-hmm. Because my, I was just a toddler and my father was transferred from Ohio to Uniontown, Pennsylvania, and Uniontown, Pennsylvania to Johnstown, Pennsylvania. And we lived with, my mother was originally from Johnstown, and my father was from Wheeling, West Virginia, and we lived with my mother's family in one house for about three years.

(2:08 - 3:21)
Alexis: And what is your connection to the steel industry? 

Ruth: My husband worked in the steel industry from the time we got married to, I'm not sure now what the date was from that, I mean, he had his layoff. 

Alexis: What, can you say what decade it was? Do you know which decade it was? 

Ruth: In the early eighties, maybe, 81, 

Alexis: Is there anything else you'd like to tell me about your family history? 

Ruth: When we moved back to Johnstown, we lived with my grandmother, and my grandfather was living at the time. I lived in the same household as my mother's sister, who was 19 years younger than she was, and was my mother's aunt, she was my great aunt.

(3:21 - 4:00)
Ruth: And then after we moved there, in about a couple of months, then my younger sister was born, and in 1943, six weeks before I was three, I'm trying to think, my two grandfathers died. One, I don't remember, maybe it was three weeks before I was three. Right, one grandfather, I guess it was the one in Wheeling, died.

(4:01 - 4:31)
Ruth: And three weeks before, my younger sister was born. And I think I said myself, no, my younger sister was born in May, and the grandfather in Wheeling died three weeks before that, and my grandpa in Pennsylvania died three weeks after that. 

Alexis: What was your family like when your husband was employed and working in the steel industry before the major industry layoffs? 

Ruth: When we first got married, it was very easy.

(4:31 - 5:16)
Ruth: It was just the two of us, and I guess you'd say we were not extravagant, and so it was very easy, we handled it. 

Alexis: I guess, what would you say made it easy? 

Ruth: We had sufficient income to be able to do whatever, and we, there were a few times out in the home, but I know like, we used checks at that time, paper checks, and that we had one in the drawer and the next one came. We had to cash the one and the next one came, so it was easy in that respect.

(5:18 - 5:50)
Alexis: Was your husband already working in the industry when you got married? 

Ruth: Yes. 

Alexis: And then during this time, I guess, what were the assigned roles in your family or the division of labor in your family? 

Ruth: My husband was the breadwinner, and I was the homemaker. So, any children that came along, I was the caregiver.

(5:52 - 6:15)
Alexis: So, you weren't working, you stayed home? 

Ruth: I stayed at home. 

Alexis: And when your husband, well, did your husband lose his job as a result of layoffs in the steel industry? 

Ruth: Yes. 

Alexis: How did your family respond to the layoff? 

Ruth: It was uncomfortable, to say the least.

(6:20 - 6:55)
Ruth: You had to tighten your belt, and you couldn't, you had to be careful what you spent on food, what you spent on, I don't know. You had to be able to pay your bills, and so all that came to priorities. 

Alexis: And then, were you making those decisions economically, or was Pap making those decisions economically? 

Ruth: I was the money manager, and most of our marriage was.

(6:55 - 7:25)
Ruth: So, during that time, I was the one in charge of making the finances work. 

Alexis: How did you, I guess, how did you manage your money? How did you? 

Ruth: Food-wise, it was an easy place to cut. The little extras, like maybe potato chips, as we had the children, in particular, the potato chips, soda, ice cream, that all just stopped.

(7:26 - 7:37)
Ruth: You couldn't have; you could not put money into unnecessary things. I would buy a little chicken, and you'd eat chicken as a chicken. You'd eat chicken in soup.

(7:37 - 8:25)
Ruth: You would eat chicken about three different ways from one little chicken to... and you ate a lot of pasta. It was money-saving things. 

Alexis: I guess, were there any other actions your family took to manage the consequences of the layoffs, financially or otherwise?

Ruth: Well, we got, used to get, I think it was butter, and I'd get a five-pound block of cheese from the government.

(8:27 - 8:54)
Ruth: For one period of time, our children ate reduced-priced lunches at school, and another period of time, they ate free lunches at school because our income was low enough to qualify for those assists. 

Alexis: And did you have to apply for those programs? 

Ruth: Oh, I think I had to. I can't exactly remember, but yes, I think you had to apply, yeah.

(8:56 - 9:30)
Alexis: And then, during the period when steel declined in Johnstown, did your family roles change in any way to respond as a result of the layoffs or Pap's jobs changing? 

Ruth: No. This home is in the process of building our house, finishing it off, we're living in it, and so he did stuff like that. Of course, he had to go down and sign up for his unemployment weekly.

(9:34 - 10:17)
Ruth: He was around the house a whole lot more, and I know because of his layoffs, he was able to help me more, in particular, I'm thinking about with the care of Dana. 

Alexis: Do you mind explaining what you mean by care of Dana? You don't have to, but. 

Ruth: Our third child had infantile spinal muscular atrophy, and they call it, um, [unintelligible], a little bit, no, that's [unintelligible].

(10:19 - 10:59)
Ruth: Oh, I can't think of the two doctors who discovered it, and I can't think of their two names right now. But that meant that all the muscles controlled by her spine for the base of her neck bone were atrophying, which means they were losing their abilities to work for her, they were too weak. She did not, um, she required full-time attention.

(11:00 - 11:33)
Ruth: She could not walk; she could not sit up by herself. She was very smart, very intelligent, a sense of humor, and Tom would give me a break to stay in bed longer in the morning, then we would get up with her. Yeah, well, Tom always carried our babies, but he especially had to help with her.

(11:42 - 12:02)
Ruth: She could play Uno, and she was able to beat Tom. However, I remember this one time, Tom was taking a break to go to the bathroom. She showed me how she was stacking the deck against him.

(12:03 - 12:14)
Ruth: She could generally beat him, but she was doing that. She was smart, she was smart. A lot of interesting moments, memories.

(12:15 - 13:07)
Alexis: So, um, so because Pap was laid off, he was able to help you out more with Dana during that time period? 

Ruth: He was, yes. Well, I don't remember just at what age, just what his status was, but even when he was working, I thought to the point where he had to help with her bathing and that because she was becoming physically too much of a challenge for me to be able to put her in a bathtub and get her out since she could not support herself, and that all was on the person helping her. Yeah.

(13:10 - 13:56)
Alexis: And then, outside of your own family, did you witness any changes in Johnstown as a result of the decline and closure of the steel mills? 

Ruth: Well, some of the mills closed. People left town, although I can remember there was one couple that they were not willing to leave town, they had a job opportunity in Texas through relatives, and they chose to turn the offer down and stay in Johnstown with unemployment, which is something we did not choose to do. 

Alexis: What did you choose to do instead? 

Ruth: Go where we could find a job, whatever that meant.

(13:56 - 14:50)
Ruth: There were probably some exceptions, depending on, I'm thinking like New York, Chicago, California, I mean, there were probably some exceptions where we would have been willing to offer a move, but generally speaking, we had to be open to moving to where we could find work. 

Alexis: And then, where did you end up moving to? 

Ruth: We, our first move was Tom went to Terre Haute, Indiana, and he was there a year by himself, only getting home to visit us every three weeks. And after a year, we decided we had enough of that, we decided to move ourselves to Terre Haute, which we did.

(14:51 - 15:39)
Ruth: He left on June 1st of, this was eighty-four, and the children wound up on June 2nd of 85. And we were over in Terre Haute for, till up from June till October, and he got laid off again, and then we were back in a strange city without a job, but he was able to find something for himself. And then he got a job contracting in Indianapolis, and he commuted daily from well Monday, he did work some Saturdays, but he didn't work Sundays, back and forth to Indianapolis for the work to Terre Haute.

(15:40 - 16:49)
Ruth: And interestingly enough, we were renting a house in Terre Haute, and it was rented to us by Anchor Glass, and it apparently sat empty for several years. And Anchor Glass, we were the first ones that they would rent to, and when the lease was up and there was a change, our rental checks and my contact person was an attorney in Tampa, Florida, and he just thought we had to buy that house. He made us a wonderful deal, generally speaking, you would know who would want to pass it down, pass it up. However, I had explained to him that Tom was already working in Indianapolis, and then we just, we were staying during that one extra year just so my daughter could graduate from high school and not have to change schools again, and she had just had eleventh and twelfth grade...

(16:49 - 17:42)
Ruth: In 11th grade, we didn't want to change her for 12th grade, so he commuted back and forth for a year while she went to school in Terre Haute and graduated, and then we had to move. He could not take that drive any longer. It was too exhausting, and some of the days he literally could come from work, ate supper, went to bed, got up, went to work, and while he ate supper, literally went to bed, and it went on like that for some days, but that was much better, having him home at night than being in Pennsylvania and him being in Terre Haute and not seeing him for weeks at a time, but that, as I said, that attorney was making us a wonderful proposition that we had to turn down.

(17:43 - 18:14)
Alexis: What was it like when, like what was your life like when he would be gone for like those week-long periods? 

Ruth: It was challenging. There were some things that I, our son was just doing eighth grade. He was strong.

(18:14 - 18:55)
Ruth: He was okay, but yet at the same time, I knew he was just a young male person, and I could not substitute him for being a man of the house. That was his dad's job, that was not his. His child was a boy, a childhood, a young person. But there were some things I had to ask for his help because I knew he was physically able to do it, and I could not do it, and one of the things that I can remember is we had a water softener, deionizer in our basement because we had deep well water, and it was not good water.

(18:56 - 19:32)
Ruth: I would go out and get the salt for it, and the man from whom I bought it, he would put it in the trunk of the car. I could only buy 40-pound bags, not 80-pound bags, and when I got home, then I had to ask my son to load the water softener and to get those bags to the basement, and get it loaded, but I couldn't do that, so it was difficult that way. It was difficult with the school.

(19:34 - 21:00)
Ruth: There were a couple of things that went on. One with our son, one with our daughter, and I ended up calling the teacher, which that wasn't something that I generally would do, but I ended up calling the teacher on both of their behaves, and I found out that they were both correct in what they were telling me, and the teachers, surprisingly, both admitted to me that what the situation was that they were wrong. One being our son had to write something because he was talking to someone, and when I called the teacher about it, he said that he anticipated he was going to talk. He really wasn't, so our son was right in saying he did not talk. And the other one was that our daughter, her one classmate who was part of the group that they ran around together, some reason, whatever, there was a falling out between him and our daughter in particular, I know, and she had that boy's father was one of her class teachers, and she said that that teacher was taking it out on her because of the breakup and the disruption in friendship that there is some.

(21:02 - 21:24)
Ruth: So, I called him, and of course you had to be tactful in how you approached these. You can't, you want them to cooperate with you. He admitted, yes, he was, he was taking it out on her, which I was, I guess, a little surprised that I got the two answers that validated my two children.

(21:26 - 21:55)
Ruth: Well, and then with that, and with our daughter, she was in, had a fella interested in her, and she was a sophomore and he was a senior, and I, her dad wasn't home, so all I kept telling her was you're too young for this. I would not tell her she could not do it. I just told her she was too young, and I didn't have her dad's support right there with me.

(21:57 - 22:23)
Ruth: And she'd go home from school one day and she said, yes, he did, he wanted to give her a school room, but she recognized he wasn't right for her, so she didn't take it. Yeah, smart girl. So, you know, there were things like that that were challenging, and when we were getting ready to move, I was all on my own.

(22:23 - 22:44)
Ruth: I had to get a moving van to make all the arrangements, to get whatever, do all that. I had some friends that helped me. I know the one lady come over and help me pack, and I sat there that evening and I looked up and there was no kitchen clock there, and I had no idea where it was, but she had packed it up for me during the day.

(22:47 - 23:24)
Ruth: But I did not have any support other than from friends in trying to make the move, to get things organized and what have you. So, I got through it, I did it. 

Alexis: But you did have friends support you? 

Ruth: I had one couple come over and I had told the people that were going to rent our house that I would have all the windows cleaned for them, and so I had this couple showed up, and I forget what they were going to help me pack or something.

(23:25 - 23:44)
Ruth: When they got there, they said, how about if her husband washed all the outsides of the windows and she washed all the insides of the windows, and meanwhile, then I was washing all the curtains and everything. So, we got that all done. And the one lady just came over and just helped me pack the one day.

(23:45 - 24:01)
Ruth: I had a cousin from out of state that came for a visit. He did a little bit of helping, not much, but he helped. So yeah, I had that kind of support.

(24:01 - 24:20)
Ruth A neighbor lady, we weren't even that close. She did bring me quiche for supper the one night, and she brought a toaster oven up for me to use and then told me to keep the toaster oven. She had two, and I still have it to this day.

(24:21 - 24:45)
Alexis: So, did people know Pap was unemployed or that he was out of town? 

Ruth: I would say on the mountain where we lived, they probably pretty much all knew the circumstances. Not maybe every other place. I think of the one place in church.

(24:47 - 25:27)
Ruth: One of the ladies asked me one time, because he wasn't around all the time, and previously when he was still back in Johnstown, he had had cancer, and he had to go for radiation, and this lady went to the same church as us, and she was with someone, and they were there too going through the radiation, so they knew we were there. And when he wasn't at church with us all the weeks that he didn't go home, she asked me one time, was he sick again? That's what she was thinking. Fortunately, I could say, no, he's working out of state.

(25:29 - 25:47)
Alexis: Was that common? Did other people have husbands working out of state too? Do you know? 

Ruth: No. I, I don't know. Well, one of the fellas who worked with Tom, I think he did that for a while too.

(25:47 - 26:07)
Ruth: He was, he wasn't out of state, he was in a different place where he was not home all week. But they did that, they did at some point, they actually moved to where he was working. But I didn't know a lot of people that did that.

(26:10 - 26:39)
Alexis: So, would you say, in general, people moved together or just stayed? Probably more of they stayed or they just moved together. I don't know how many people were willing to move on. But I think possibly, it's my influence in freedom to move on is, my mother did that.

(26:40 - 27:02)
Ruth: So that was not foreign to me, that when my husband had to leave, that I would go with him. And there was no question in my mind that I would go with him. One of my children, I won't say which one, wanted to know, 'Are you going with him?' 'Yes?' 'Okay.'

(27:03 - 27:26)
Ruth: I'm not real sure what they thought of, I think we were going to just stay there our whole life. 

Alexis: Did you witness any changes in Johnstown as a, I might've already asked you this, but as a city, as a result of the decline and closure of the steel mills? 

Ruth: I don't know. Because you were on the mountain.

(27:26 - 27:58)
Alexis: Yeah, so I was going to say- 

Ruth: I don't know that I was exposed to a lot of that stuff. And there was, of course, that we had that flood, and there was a lot of things that would happen as a result of that flood. That, because where we lived and our exposure to what we were exposed, I probably, may have felt more influenced by the flood than the layoff.

(27:59 - 28:09)
Ruth: But the layoff, obviously, it wasn't just a layoff that he had. He had multiple layoffs. He'd get back to work and then he'd lay off, and back to work and lay off.

(28:10 - 28:33)
Ruth: And in the last one big, big, big time, he didn't work for 15 months. That was hard.

Alexis: I guess, did you witness any changes on the mountain as a result of steel layoffs? Were there people up on the mountain that were also working the steel mills? 

Ruth: Well, I know his dad did, his uncle did.

(28:35 - 28:44)
Ruth: His, the man that lived next door to us did. They were more like laborers. Tom was in the office.

(28:45 - 28:54)
Ruth: The man up the road, I think he was in the office. And I'm not really sure what the other people did. I just don't know.

(28:54 - 29:44)
Alexis: Was there a difference for the laborers versus the office people in the layoffs? 

Ruth: Yes, I think so. I think, yeah, I think there was a difference in that area. 

Alexis: And then, how would you say, like, the community responded to the decline and closure of steel mills in Johnstown? 

Ruth: Well, I mean, I guess it had to be difficult, challenging, what happened to the families with, you know, they didn't have income and what have you.

(29:47 - 30:09)
Ruth: I know, you know, how we made it. I don't know just how some of the other ones made it. Oh, I know of a couple that, he was left go, I think it was like three months before he could have, not old enough, but ten-year-wise, he could have retired.

(30:10 - 30:22)
Ruth: It was three months short, and they left him go. And I do know his wife went out and started paying comms. That led one way or another, they were taking care of themselves.

(30:25 - 30:54)
Alexis: And then, do you know of anybody with experiences you think I should reach out to for this oral history project? 

Ruth: No. I can't. Like he said, a lot of times that he worked with, the one couple that I think of, unfortunately, they're both now deceased, but he was a city policeman.

(30:54 - 31:13)
Ruth: They would have had a feel for what was going on in the whole city. 

Alexis: Did they have any children? 

Ruth: Yes, they had four boys. 

Alexis: Do you have contact information for them? 

Ruth: No, not really.

(31:14 - 31:30)
Ruth: The last I spoke with anyone was back when, relating to my close friend. Has she restored any of them? No. They're all in a different state from Pennsylvania.

(31:31 - 31:41)
Ruth: Three of them are in different states. One is in Pennsylvania, but not back in the area. 

Alexis: Well, thank you so much for telling me all that.

(31:42 - 31:43)
Ruth: Okay, you're welcome.
