## Interview Summary
Ruth Demko was interviewed by her granddaughter Alexis Shoulta at her home in Greenwood, Indiana, on December 2, 2025. This interview is a follow up interview to Ruth Demko Oral History 1, collected on October 5, 2025.

Ruth grew up in downtown Johnstown. When she went to high school there were two tracks, academic or commercial. Academic would have been a college track, and commercial was preparing students for the workforce. Ruth learned to write in shorthand on the commercial track. She was expected to work until she was married. 

She worked for an attorney before she was married. She and Tom did not want her to work after she was married and she planned only to work for six months after. However, this didn't happen because she was let go. She does not know for certain, but she guesses that she was let go because her boss did not want a married woman working in his office. She says that this was a collective understanding, and she says it might be because of old school ideas that women belong at home.

Before they were married, Tom told Ruth that he believed if someone didn't have the money to pay cash for something they couldn't afford it. Ruth didn't have a problem with this because she was the type of person too. Even before she was married, she would save her money.

She doesn't recall the city ever being as busy or discordant as up on the mountains surrounding the city where she moved after marrying Tom. People on the mountain had shared telephone lines, and people would listen to one another’s conversations. Ruth didn't like this and insisted on having a private line. It took six months for it to be installed. On the mountain they lived around her husband Tom's family. There were only about three to five families living up on that mountain.

When they first got married, Tom would keep his paycheck. And one time, he brought home his next check, and the first one was still untouched. For a while, Tom managed the finances alone, and it didn't work well. Then Ruth managed them alone and it also didn't work well. They tried doing them together and didn't like that either, so managing the money came back to solely being Ruth's job.

Ruth prefers the term homemaker over housewife. As a homemaker Ruth's jobs at home were to take care of the children, cook, clean, and take care of her mother. When her children were in school, she would wake up, get them ready and make them breakfast. When they got older, she didn't have to do as much and would listen to see if they were on task and then would be with them at the door when they left. Once the kids were at school, her day was comprised of taking care of her daughter, Dana. 

Dana's daily care was dependent upon her physical state of the day. Some days Ruth would have to perform "percussion” on her or would give her medication. Percussion was where Ruth would tap on Dana's chest when she had pneumonia to break up buildup in her lungs. Dana could not cough on her own, and she had pneumonia over twenty-one times. Ruth would also physically set her up to play and change her diapers. 

Dana was educated at home. There was a program called Appalachia Intermediate Unit 8. They provided teachers to come to the home to teach her several times a week. The final year she was alive, she was doing first-grade course work. The school district had wanted to send a schoolteacher to come to the house to work with Dana after he finished his school days. Ruth objected to this because Dana would be too tired by that time of the day. So, she had to continue with the Appalachia Unit 8, but the teacher sourced her curriculum from the local school. 

When the family went out, they took her everywhere. They also traveled with her. Tom built Dana a wheelchair from a stroller, and it was able to fold down so they could travel with it as well. The Muscular Dystrophy Association was willing to buy her a wheelchair, but at the time they could not find one that met Dana's needs. There were no ramps, so Tom would pick up her chair to move her up and down steps. At home, Dana slept upstairs and she needed to be carried up and down the stairs as well.

They avoided people that they knew to be sick. The only class Dana took with other children was her religious education courses. Ruth recalls that Dana was thrilled to be able to be around the other students. They also took Dana to be treated at the NIH at the National Institutes of Neurological Disease and Stroke. Pittsburgh Children's Hospital sent a neurologist to their local hospital every six months for muscular dystrophy.

When Ruth cooked or baked, it was from scratch. When Tom came home from work, the family would have their evening meal. As the years went on, Ruth really wanted to get the kids bathed and to bed in the evening. Tom was responsible for getting the kids bathed and ready for bed, and it was then that she was able to sit and relax and drink coffee. Then the family would all say nightly prayers together.

Occasionally, an older bachelor that lived close to them, Jim, would watch the children on his property for Ruth. However, if Dana went up there, Ruth would go with her. Jim had a huge meadow and a creek on his property, so the children really liked playing there. She thinks that Jim found it homey to be close with her family, and he was lifelong friends with Tom's father. 

When Tom was unemployed, he would get up in the mornings and take care of Dana so that she could sleep in. He would get Dana set up to watch her TV show. They would also like to play Uno together. He also built their house during the layoff. She could not return to work or bring in alternate forms of income when Tom was laid off because Dana needed her care. If she went back to work, Tom would have to take over as Dana's primary caretaker, and the house wouldn't have been able to be built. However, Ruth didn't really want to return to work, she was content with homemaking.

Ruth recalls that during the layoffs they were aware that it was bad in the area. Tom would hear about if other workers were hired somewhere and then would apply for the same places.

Tom started having to commute further from home to find work. He got a job working in York, Pennsylvania and would be gone for the whole week and come home on the weekends. He travelled and lived in a boarding house with another man from their area that was doing the same thing. Ruth recalls that there were no other options for work. They did not move to be with him because he was not at those jobs for long, and some of the companies were going out of business. It would have been financially unfeasible to keep moving themselves. After York, Tom began working in Terre Haute, Indiana in 1984. For a year he would come home one weekend every three weeks.

Ruth says these times were hard. Their children needed their father, and she needed her husband. It could be lonely for her without him. She had to adapt to doing work that he would have done and sometimes had to rely on her son. After the first year of Tom working in Terre Haute, the company wanted him to continue working there and the family made the decision to move. They felt that the job was secure enough to warrant it. However, only a few months after the move Tom ended up being laid off again. So, Tom started commuting for an hour and a half each way to Indianapolis.

When Tom was commuting this way, it was better for her that he was home, however he would go to work come home and go straight to bed.

When Tom was laid off, they would budget their money and sometimes cut back on food to save money. Sometimes they used envelopes as a method of managing their money. She cooked pasta and would make three meals out of a single chicken. She says at the time she just did what she had to do. She tried to make things from scratch because it was cheaper. When asked if liked to cook she expresses that it was her job and she just did it because it was what women did. She says she didn't think about it any other way.

The family got some food from the government like cheese and butter, and the children would get reduced and eventually free. They tried to get utilities assistance, but they didn't qualify because they reviewed their income from three months before when Tom was still working. They also attempted to get SSI for Dana but did not qualify for it because they would have had to have virtually no assets. Even if they had qualified, they would deduct one fifth of Tom's unemployment.

Ruth was not taught how to cook or clean by her mother. Although her mother did do these jobs, she says her mother didn't teach her because she was out of the home working. Instead, Ruth learned from recipe books, and trial and error. She says she was able to learn easily and did not struggle. 

Ruth was at one time treasurer of the PTA. When she was serving, the whole family would go, because it was dangerous to drive back up the mountain at night. There were no streetlights or houses. She and Tom also joined the Compassionate Friends, a support group for grieving parents after Dana died, 

The family moved to Greenwood in 1987 after their oldest daughter Karen graduated from high school. 

Ruth identifies her husband's career as stabilizing only when he retired. Ruth did not think that her and Tom would be able to have a good retirement. She told her oldest granddaughter that she used to think they would be eating dog food. There were many years when they were unable to save money. After they finished paying off their children's college expenses they saved as much as they could while Tom was still working.

Ruth recalls that their life was primarily made up of the duties that they had to do, and that they didn't have much of a social life. When asked, she says that she thinks these expectations came from the example she saw as a child. 

She also recalls that after Tom retired, she was used to being home alone by herself, and she told Tom she didn't realize he talked a lot until he retired. She wasn't home alone with him very much before then. Tom says it was hard for him to adjust to staying in the house.

Ruth currently lives with her husband Tom in Greenwood, Indiana.

## Transcript

Note: Throughout this interview "Pap" refers to Ruth Demko's husband, Tom Demko. He was also present during the interview and chimed in with some of his recollections.

(0:00 - 1:36)
Alexis Shoulta: Hello, can you say your name for the camera please?

Ruth Demko: Ruth Demko.

Alexis: And who am I?

Ruth: You're my granddaughter, Alexis Shoulta.

Alexis: Yeah, it is December 2nd and we're doing a second oral history interview.

Alexis: Thank you for sharing your experiences with me today. As I previously mentioned, the study aims to collect oral histories and recollections of deindustrialization and family in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. I'm studying the impacts of change in the work environment on families and people's life experiences.

Our interview today should last approximately an hour. I'm going to ask you a series of questions about your family and experiences with steel in Johnstown. This interview is being recorded for oral history preservation and historical analysis purposes.

If you need to take a break at any time, let me know and I can pause the recording and interview and we'll go back over your concept form at the end of the interview to review and confirm your previous choices.

Okay, so we've talked previously about how your husband was laid off working as a draftsman in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, and I kind of wanted to elaborate more on some of the experiences we've previously discussed related to this.

Can you kind of describe what your day was like as a housewife at home while your husband was working? Like what you would do in a day?

Ruth: Of course, take care of the children and make meals. I cleaned, did the cleaning.

(1:45 - 2:55)
Ruth: I don't know. My mother lived with us for about three and a half years and so she required some care. I'm not sure what else to say.

Alexis: I guess, could you, would you be able to give me an example of like what a day would be like? Like you'd wake up and then you would do this, like if you if you remember like what like your average like what your schedule would kind of be like you'd wake up and you'd like get ready for the day and then you do this for the kids like you kind of give me maybe a schedule?

Ruth: Well, when the children were in school, of course I got up and I would get them ready for school and make their breakfast. As they got older I would, I would, sometimes I would go back and lay in bed and listen to what they were doing and then get up and be at the door with them when they were going to go out.

(3:00 - 4:08)
Ruth: Then after they were all off to school, of course when I had Dana, my day was comprised of a lot of taking care of her.

Alexis: What was that like?

Ruth: Well, you know, make sure she had her meal. Depending on how she was doing, what, if I had to do any percussion, I would give her any meds at the time, whatever was going on.

Get her set up for playing and she, and we got her...
 
Tom Demko: Changed diapers.

Ruth: Yes, I changed diapers. I had children in diapers for about 13 years or so.

(4:09 - 4:16)
Ruth: So, yes, I changed diapers. I did laundry. I spent a lot of time cooking, baking.

(4:19 - 4:45)
Ruth: And I did scratch cooking, scratch baking. And when Tom came home from work, we would have our evening meal. And as the years passed, it got to be where, when the children were younger especially, all I wanted to do in the evening was to get them bathed and get them ready to get off to bed.

(4:46 - 5:07)
Ruth: And so, as time went on, it was just like Tom would get everybody bathed first. And while I sat and relaxed with the paper and had my coffee that I could drink at the time, he would bathe them, get them all ready. And when they were ready for bed, he'd call me up and we'd all sit on my purse together.

(5:07 - 5:25)
Alexis: You'd drink a cup of coffee before you went to sleep? You could drink caffeine and sleep?

Ruth: At supper time, right there in the evening, yes, I could. The caffeine never seemed to bother me. And then it got to be decaf coffee.

(5:27 - 6:09)
Ruth: No, that caffeine didn't seem to bother me.

Alexis: And you also mentioned, and I just want to clarify because I'm not sure if I remember correctly, you did percussion on Dana, which was, was it to help her breathe?

Ruth: If she had pneumonia or whatever because she couldn't cough, I had to do the percussion on her chest to like loosen up and get her digestive and that relieved.

Alexis: And Dana had pneumonia quite a few times and you nursed her?

Ruth: Yes, I, yes, I quit counting at 21.

(6:11 - 6:36)
Ruth: And so yes, during her times with pneumonia, I would definitely be doing percussion several times a day.

Alexis: So, you primarily took care of Dana at home. Were there any resources for assistance with that, with helping take care of her?

Ruth: Well, she was educated at home.

(6:37 - 7:44)
Ruth: We had a program, it was called Appalachian Intermediate Unit 8, and they provided teachers. And as she got older, they increased the amount of times a week they would see her. And they would come to the house; they would work with her.

And they were different, they were different women, different people, and so their interactions with Dana were different. And they had the different programs. But that last year, she was doing first grade schoolwork, and the school district had wanted to send a kindergarten teacher, not kindergarten, first grade teacher, after her day was done, her, his day was done, to come to our house.

(7:44 - 10:06)
Ruth: And at that time, I objected because that would be too late in the day for her. She would be too worn out at that time of the day. And so, they had to go back to an Appalachian Intermediate Unit 8 teacher.

But she went to the school district and got all those schoolbooks and things and used her first grade was what the schools were doing, too. She was learning the same way.

Alexis: And then, was Dana able to go and participate in things outside the house, or was it mostly that her schooling, well obviously her schooling was at home, but were her doctor visits also at home, or would she go to the doctor's office, or was she able to go out and do things?

Ruth: No, the doctor's visits were at the doctor's office.

Yes, we took her everywhere. We did not take her around someone who obviously had a cold or was sick, as we did not want her to pick it up. But yes, she was, she vacationed with us.

She, the only thing that she did in a classroom was her first-grade religious education, and she was thrilled to be able to do that. She was able. That was her opportunity with fellow classmates, and so she did that.

We did not overly protect her, but we protected her. When I say we didn't overly, I mean we took her out. We did places.

She was, she went to church with us. She went shopping with us. She went on vacation with us.

Alexis: Where'd you guys take her on vacation?

Ruth: Myrtle Beach, Chicago. Is there someone else we took her?

Tom: Delaware.

Ruth: Oh yeah, Delaware.

(10:08 - 13:04)
Ruth: My sister lived in Delaware at the time, so yeah, we took her to Delaware.

Alexis: Did you guys?

Tom: Some of the hospitals too.

Alexis: Yeah, the hospital.

Tom: The NIH

Alexis: Yeah, that's right. She went to the NIH.

Ruth: She was in the National Institutes of Neurological Disease and Stroke. She was, we took her to Hershey.

Yeah, and to Hershey, the city at Hershey.

Alexis: When you would travel, would you bring her wheelchair too? Because I know Pap built her one.

Ruth: Oh, absolutely.

Alexis: So, was it like, how did you pack it up in the car?

Tom: It was a foldable one.

Ruth: It was, what'd you say? It was a foldable one. Yeah.

Tom: It was flat.

Ruth: Yeah, well we could take the seat off and the base we'd fold it.

Alexis: And that was the one Pap made?

Tom: The chair, yeah.

Alexis: So, you built it to intentionally be collapsible?

Ruth: No, the base was a stroller base because it started out as a stroller with the stroller seat. And so, it was a collapsible base that you attached the seat. And so, the seats that Pap had to make, they were made to attach to the stroller base.

And eventually the base got a little worn for us. And Pittsburgh Children's Hospital sent a neurologist into our local hospital every six months for muscular dystrophy. And because, no.

Tom: You said that was spinal muscular dystrophy?

Ruth: Right. I was trying to think of the doctor's official's medical name. They would see her because that was one of the muscular dystrophies coverage.

Tom: And, um. Dr. Painter?

Ruth: Pardon?

Tom: Dr. Painter?

Rut: Yeah, well she was in Children's Hospital, Dr. Painter. She was in NIH.

And the Muscular Dystrophy Association was willing to buy her a wheelchair. But we could not find anything in production at that time that would have accommodated her needs.

Alexis: Was it hard with the wheelchair to like navigate like physical landscapes? Like were sidewalks built? Like did they have ramps to get on and off like a sidewalk?

Ruth: We didn't have a problem, but I don't think they had ramps like they do now.

(13:05 - 14:26)
Alexis: I don't remember. Pick up the moving device and chair at the same time as Dana and go from one place to another with it. She only weighed twenty pounds.

Alexis: If you had to go upstairs, did you do the same thing?

Ruth: Yeah. Well, at home.

Tom: We took her up to bed.

Ruth: Yeah, we took her upstairs, but he carried her.

Alexis: And then, so we kind of got into Dana from talking about Pap's, like what your life was like while Pap was working. And then could you kind of describe maybe how it was when Pap wasn't working? Like when he was laid off and he would be home, did the dynamic on like how work was divided change or did things stay the same?

Ruth: Well, Pap would let me stay in bed more in the morning and he would get Dana up and take care of her.

She played Uno with Pap. She knew how to beat him. She was very smart, absorbent, sense of humor.

(14:28 - 14:40)
Ruth: There was nothing wrong with her mentally. It was just a physical situation. I'm trying to think of some of the other words to describe her.

(14:45 - 15:44)
Alexis: So, Pap was able to help you with getting her up in the morning and things like that. Was there anything else throughout the day?

Ruth: I'm not sure how much Pap did during the day. I don't remember.

Maybe he does. He used to set her up for that TV show she watched. But I don't know.

Pap built our house and so I'm not sure how much he was still doing work on the house.

Alexis: Oh, were you building the house during the lay-off?

Tom: All the time.

Alexis: And then, did you go back to work when Pap got laid off ever?

Ruth: No.

Alexis: Or do anything else bring money in?

Ruth: Well, I had... No, I didn't. I had Dana to take care of. I couldn't go back and work.

(15:47 - 16:07)
Ruth: I mean, I don't know. It would have been a trade-off if he took over and I went to work and nothing else then maybe would get done around the house with the building or what needed to be done. I'm not sure at that point how much was left to be done.

(16:08 - 16:56)
Alexis: Was that something, I guess... Did you get a sense of like when Pap would be laid off, lots of people would be laid off, would you get a sense of like a change in community during layoffs? Like, would there be lots of people that didn't have jobs or people looking for jobs all at once? Or was it kind of you were... Because you were on the mountain, you weren't really super plugged in?


Ruth: Well, I guess I think we were aware of that there was bad in the area. So yes, there would be a lot of layoffs. And it happened here, someone got hired somewhere and then he'd go there, but no, he went.

He didn't get hired. And I don't know, you know, just why that was. Maybe they met their limits for hiring or whatever.

(16:59 - 18:25)
Alexis: And then, I guess, did you work before you were a stay-at-home mom?

Ruth: I did not work after we were married. So, what did you do?

Alexis: Like, where did you work before you got married then?

Ruth: I worked for an attorney.

Alexis: Did you always plan to not work after you got married?

Ruth: Yes, Pap did not want me to work, and I really didn't choose to either. I was only going to work like the first six months, but that didn't happen because I got laid off.

Alexis: And was that, with being laid off, is it the same as like, with, was that in town? Like, was it a cut at the company? Like lots of people stopped working at the same time?

Ruth: No, it was an individual and it was me.

Alexis: You don't have to answer it. Do you know why they laid you off?

Ruth: I do not know why. My guess was that he did not want a married woman working for him.

Alexis: Was that a common sentiment?

Ruth: Um, yes, I think, at those days, yes, that might be that they didn't want a married woman working for them.

(18:28 - 20:41)
Alexis: I guess, could you kind of, like, could you kind of explain, like, what the cultural, like, like, I guess, the common understanding of why that was? Was there an understanding, or was it just that it wasn't done?

Ruth: It may have been some of the old school stuff where the woman belongs at home. I can't really answer for him. Yeah, and it more of like, I guess, a cultural, like, I don't know, like, why, I guess, I'm trying to guess, why maybe people thought that way, but, um, did you ever, after you got married, did you ever want to work again?

Ruth: No, no, I was content, and I managed to stay busy during the day with whatever.

I remember when we first got married, we probably had the cleanest living room, until I figured out a schedule and whatever, and then I didn't know what to do with myself, so I cleaned the living room.

Alexis Um, and then Pap eventually got a job in Terre Haute, which was quite far from Johnstown, Pennsylvania.

Ruth: Yeah, but before that, though, Pap got work, it wasn't in Johnstown, but it was in Pennsylvania, and he traveled.

Alexis: Where in Pennsylvania?

Ruth: Well, he traveled to Plum Township for work, which was

Tom: near Pittsburgh.

Ruth: Yeah, it was going towards Pittsburgh. I don't remember what was it, about an hour,

Tom: fifty miles one way,

Ruth: and then he worked in York, Pennsylvania, and he was gone all week, and he came and lived in a boarding house with another fellow that was doing the same from our area, and they traveled back and forth together, and he was at least home on weekends before he went to Terre Haute.

(20:43 - 22:38)
Alexis: How did, um, I guess, do you recall, like, how you guys made the decision that he would be away for periods of time like that?

Ruth: We didn't. He had to have a job. He took a job where he could get to work, and there wasn't no, there was no option.

You know, you had to do what you had to do.

Alexis: Yeah, I guess, um, why, like, eventually you moved to Terre Haute, but with, like, the ones in Pennsylvania, why didn't you move in Pennsylvania? Like, why did you stay in Johnstown?

Tom: Starvation wages

Ruth: He wasn't at the jobs that long, really. I mean, the one he got laid off, and the company, I think, eventually folded.

The other one, um, it's because we, he, because he, um, left there to go to Terre Haute, but with their, they weren't a situation where we would have just have to move.

Alexis: They weren't secure.

Ruth: Yeah, we'd be going more in-depth trying to keep moving ourselves.

Alexis: Makes sense. And then, what was it like for you when Pap would be away for, like, most of the week, or the whole week, when he was in other parts of Pennsylvania or in Terre Haute?

Ruth: Well, at least in Pennsylvania, he was home on the weekends, but in Terre Haute, it was a whole year. He'd go home maybe every three weeks, and it was hard because our children needed their father, as well as me.

(22:43 - 23:17)
Ruth: It could be lonely, even though I had the children and whatever. It could be lonely without him. I, you know, had to adapt to doing things that he would have done that I, and to call on our son for assistance when I needed it, but he was just a boy, and I knew he could not be a substitute for his father, but there were some things I needed his physical, physical ability to help me with.

(23:18 - 23:47)
Alexis: Um, and then, I guess, when and how did you guys decide you were going to move to Terre Haute then?

Ruth: When Pap came home at Christmas, and he told me that they wanted him to come back after the first year, because it was only supposed to be a six-month position.

Alexis: Which year was that?

Ruth: 1984. And that, he, when he came home at Christmas and said that they wanted him to go back again after the first year, I was devastated.

(23:48 - 25:17)
Ruth: Um, but we did it. We did what we had to do, and finally we made the decision. It was just, we did not like being apart, and it seemed like his job was going to be okay, and so we moved ourselves there after a year.

He had been, he left June 1st of 84, and we left June 2nd of 85, and um, we were there as a family, moved in, [unintelligible] from June to October, and he was laid off again, so that we were again in a less than familiar surroundings to get through this all over again. And then he, uh, got, um, contracting job again, is that the, some of the jobs are contracting jobs, and they're not permanent. So, uh, he was working over in Indianapolis, commuting every day with another fella, an hour and a half each way, and some of the consolation was that he come home at night, so we, he, some of the hours were long, and the trips were an hour and a half long, so he'd get up in the morning, go to work, come home, eat supper, shower, and go to bed.

(25:18 - 30:48)
Ruth: And so, but at least he was home in the evenings, but we didn't know him much and it's better than being miles apart. Um, and with work being inconsistent, um, and therefore, I guess, paychecks being inconsistent, how did you manage, like, the household money? Like, did you guys change your budgeting or your spending to accommodate? Well, mostly, I think we were always, we were not big, big, elaborate spenders. We learned just that wasn't us, but the way to cut back was food, not, not putting everything, or there were no treats, no ice cream, no potato chips, no soda, nothing like that.

Just ate what you, bought what you had to buy.

Alexis: And how would you, like, are you, do you, are you able to explain, like, how you'd budget, like, your food budget with what you decided to cook?

Ruth: Um, I, I'm not real sure how to answer that. We, at one time, we did have a budget where we put certain amount of money in envelopes for the different things, and so I imagine we had a food envelope, too.

I can't quite remember, but I think we probably did.

Alexis: I can rephrase it. Did you cook, like, a certain type of way to keep, um, to keep your spending low? Like, there are types of food you cooked because they weren't as expensive to make?

Ruth: Pasta was, uh, used, um, and I would buy just a, a little chicken and would eat chicken dinner, and then I would make soup from it, and then I'd make something else.

We'd get three meals out of it. Um, but, um, you just, at the time, you just did what you had to do.

Alexis: Did you still bake? Would you stop baking?

Ruth: I, I can't remember so much. Like when we were in Terre Haute and all that, but I really, um, generally speaking, I was a big baker, a big cook, which I don't do very, very little of now, but I, I don't know because when you made it home, like, it went, it wasn't as expensive as buying it, so I, I don't remember just how much baking and that I did. I, I probably did when we lived in Terre Haute. I probably still do the baking.

Alexis: And you, I know you liked to bake. Did you like to cook too? Like, did you enjoy it?

Ruth: It was just something, it was my, my job. I just did it.

I guess, I don't know, I guess I liked it. I didn't like the clean-up. I did all the pots and pans and that, but, um, yeah, it was just, it was almost, I guess, well into that category where this is what the woman does.

She bakes, she cooks, she does laundry, but I never, I didn't really think about it any other way.

Alexis: And were you taught how to do those things by your mom?

Ruth: No.

Alexis: Did your mom do those things?

Ruth: I, I asked my mother to teach me how to cook, and she said by the time I got home from work and, and she tried to explain everything, just never happened.

I learned by, from recipe books. I learned about a little trial and error, but I think I was given a lot of ability to be able to do that. I think that I did not have to struggle to learn how to do these things.

I could pretty much follow a recipe and pretty much understood it and was able to do it.

Alexis: And then, how did, um, how did Pap's, like, career stabilize eventually? Like, over time?

Ruth: He retired.

Alexis: He retired? Is that when it stabilized when he retired?

Ruth: Well, kind of, yes, because there was questionable things along the years, you know, was he going to get laid off, or wasn't he? And so, to some degree, that's when it all stabilized when he retired.

We were, do you agree with that, Pap?

Tom: Yep.

Alexis: When did you guys move to Greenwood?

Ruth: 1987. Your mother graduated from high school on, um, Monday and we moved Saturday.

(30:51 - 31:17)
Alexis: Um, and then, you one time, you jokingly, you know, you always, not jokingly, half-jokingly, you told me that, um, you didn't think you were going to be able to have money in your retirement. Said you used to think that you would be eating dog food.

Ruth: I know, no I wasn't kidding.

I did. I thought I'd be eating dog food and cat food. I did not think we were going to have a good retirement.

(31:17 - 32:19)
Alexis: I didn't think because there were so many years where we could not save money. Uh, and so, I did think it would be tough. So, I guess the question would be, like, so how did you guys pull it off? Like, how did you?

Ruth: After we finished paying for college expenses, we saved like crazy.

Uh, the maximum taken out of his pay and we just really pushed real hard to save the few years that we had left when we worked after, um, after, um, most of the, uh, through college. And so, we, we just did.

Alexis: Um, so, you, but you still, were you still, were you, did you fund both of my mom's and Chris's education?

Ruth: Yes, both of our children came out of college debt-free.

(32:21 - 32:35)
Ruth: Uncle Chris had to pay for his last semester.

Alexis: How did, so, I guess I'd say, you must be good with money then, with budgeting.

(32:38 - 33:15)
Ruth: Um, yes. Yes, even with the, from the time I was single, I can remember there was a sweater wanted and I kept going back, looking at it, looking at it, and looking at it and never bought it. My mother was saying to me about it, 'I think even if you had money, you still would be like that.' Yeah, I just really wouldn't be doing it.

Alexis: Is there anything else you'd like to share, I guess, that I haven't asked about?

Ruth: Well, when you said about the budgeting, that when we first got married, Pap said, if you can't afford to pay cash for it, you can't afford it.

(33:16 - 33:56)
Ruth: And I didn't have any problem with that. I was saving my drapes for the living room, and I remember one of the, a woman said to me about, like, 'how could you do that?' Well, I wanted the drapes. You know, just save money, go ahead, but enough to get the drapes.

It might have sounded like a big challenge with Pap telling me, if you can't afford to pay cash for it, you can't afford it, but I was that type of person, too. If I didn't have, I was not like, well, you didn't have charge cards then, and I was, I saved. I put money aside till I got enough to do what I wanted to do.

(33:58 - 34:23)
Alexis: And then, I guess I know this because I'm your granddaughter. How did it come to be that you were managing the family finances?

Ruth: How did it come to be?

Alexis: Yeah, like when you guys, is that a decision you guys made together?

Ruth: When we first got married, he, check came home. The check went into his drawer, and I can remember one time, another check came, and that first check was still lying there.

(34:23 - 34:47)
Ruth: So, we were doing really well, but we tried for a while to let Pap run the finances, and that didn't seem to work too well. So, they let me work on them, and that didn't work too well, and then we tried both of us working them, and that didn't work too well, and we went back to me, and I just, I took care of everything ever since. I still take care of it.

(34:50 - 35:37)
Alexis: And then, was there any social services you guys relied on during his layoff?

Ruth: Well, we did get cheese, there was butter also. We got those routinely according to whatever that was, and I can't think just what group that was, but it was a government-sponsored thing. And for school, the children, for a while, they got part of their lunch paid for, and then it got to where they got free lunches because of our income level.

(35:39 - 36:04)
Ruth: So, yes, we had that, but we tried to get help with our utilities, but what they did is they calculated the three months before what your income was, and of course, that's when Pap was working. And so, we did not qualify. They did not look at what we were getting at the time.

(36:05 - 36:41)
Ruth: We even tried to get SSI for Dana, and we did not qualify for it, and if we did qualify for it, they said that they would deduct a fifth of Pap's unemployment because that's what she was entitled to, a fifth of his unemployment. They said they would deduct that, and they told us that we could not have anything. We had to sell all any assets that we had, even life insurance policies, a car.

(36:41 - 37:26)
Ruth: Even though we lived out on the mountain, we were not allowed to have a vehicle unless we could prove someone needed it for medical reasons once a month, which at that time, Pap was receiving medical care once a month because of his cancer surgery, and so we qualified for the car, but nothing else, and I remember your mother saying to me about selling things, and I told her, no, we're not doing that. Once we sell it, we'll never get it back.

Alexis: Yeah, SSI is really stringent.

SSI is really strict about you have to have very little assets to actually qualify for it.

Ruth: Yep, yep. Basically, we were not allowed to have anything.

(37:27 - 39:14)
Alexis: Were you, I know you worked a lot at home, and you were responsible for Dana, so that was a lot of your time. Were you ever part of any organizations, or was there any, while you were in this period, did you have any personal groups or things you did for you personally?

Ruth: I was treasurer for the PTA at one time, but what that meant was that the whole family went to them because we were on the mountain, and I had to go up the [unintelligible] two miles up to the main road and go out and whatever, and it was the very dark, the one night coming home, and I could not see the turn. I knew I was in the area, but I was looking for that turn to get down the road to the house, and I could not slow down and watch for it because there were vehicles right behind me, and so I ended up being forced to drive all the way up along, down off the mountain and back through the road, and then come from the bottom of the mountain back up, and that road was pitch black, and there were like no street lights, no houses, and you didn't have cell phones at that time, and I was so scared. And then after that, I never went to a PTA meeting myself.

(39:15 - 40:00)
Ruth: Tom and the three children, there Dana went too, and then we all went to PTA meetings. I'm trying to think, well, no, I guess I really didn't. I had friends, but not lots of folks and stuff like that.

Tom and I both, after we lost Dana, we helped with our church festivals. We worked at them...

Tom: Compassionate Friends.

Ruth: Pardon?

Tom: Compassionate Friends, too.

Ruth: Oh, that was, yeah, after we lost Dana. Tom and I joined the Compassionate Friends. For children, for parents had lost a child to death.

(40:01 - 41:12)
Ruth: We were involved with that.

Alexis: And then, I guess, did you, so you were, you grew up in the city, in Johnstown, like downtown Johnstown.

Ruth: Right

Alexis: And then you lived up on the mountain once you got, after you got married.

Ruth: Right.

Alexis: What was that adjustment like?

Ruth: Well, oh.

Tom: Quiet in the city, traffic in the afternoon?

Ruth: Where I lived in the city, I was not exposed to as much traffic as I had on that mountain, and there was more fighting on that mountain than I had in the city, and...

Tom: More gossip.

Ruth: Well, the, they had party lines on that mountain, and so, I don't know if all of them or someone in particular that had a habit of listening in on the conversations, which resulted in fighting.

(41:13 - 42:49)
Alexis: Can you, can you explain a party line?

Ruth: A party line was where, one, one line for four different people, and if you heard certain clicks in that, you could tell when someone was on, or if you picked up the phone to use it and someone was talking, what you were expected to do was to hang it up and give them time and then go back and pick it up again and listen and do the same thing, but up on the mountain there, if they heard some click or something, whatever it was they could hear, they would pick up and listen in, and they were very quiet about picking up to listen in.

Alexis: Who was they? Was it your neighbors?

Tom: Yeah.

Ruth: It was everybody that lived up there on the mountain, you know, relatives and others, and I told Pap I would not move up into that mountain if I, I would not have a phone on that mountain if I had to have a party line.

I wasn't going to do it. So, we got a semi-private, and his aunt across the road got one at the same time. We had to wait six months to get it because they had to run the lines, and then the party line wasn't, the semi-private, one other person, that wasn't working out the best either, and so Pap, because of what I was telling him when he came home, he'd say call and get a private line.

(42:49 - 46:46)
Ruth: Well, I wouldn't do that, and so Pap came home from work one day and he told me, he said 'I called today on the lunch hour, and we ordered a private line.' So, when his aunt lived across the road from us, that when we moved up there and got the semi-private, she got the semi-private, and then when I said I was getting the private, she got a private too. So, she and I, the two of us at the first time got a, at the same time we got our private lines.

Alexis: Was that Bertha?

Ruth: Yeah, Bertha. Yeah, she wasn't, I guess, real happy with her semi-private person either. I don't know how it would have worked out if she and I would have been the semi-private people, but yeah, so we did, but got private lines.

Alexis: Did you, you lived around a lot of family?

Ruth: Well, his dad's sister lived right across the road from us. His dad's brother lived on the other, and then it was his dad, and then on the other side of his dad was the other brother, and then like he brought me up to the mountain, and his cousin, his uncle's son brought his wife up to the mountain, so you had all of them, and then you had another family where, you know, the children came back up to the mountain, so you had about three families on the mountain with multiple relatives.

Alexis: generations. Yeah.

So it was, it was a tight-knit community in that way, like it was very family, family-based?

Ruth: I guess you could say in that way, yes.

Tom: No strangers, no non-relatives.

Ruth: Pardon?

Tom: No non-relatives of the five families.

Ruth: Relatives in?

Tom: Just the five families and the offspring.

Alexis: So, it was just, it was just five families on the mountain?

Tom: Yeah, and their offspring.

Ruth: I'm counting three. Yeah, well, of course, Jim up the road, he didn't have that.

Tom: I didn't count him.

Alexis: Poor Jim. 

Ruth: He was a nice man. Yeah.

And I will say, mentioning Jim, he was a bachelor, and he was okay, and at the time I was, would write my notes down in shorthand, and he'd like to stand there and look at them on the refrigerator and try and read them, because he knew, I guess, in shorthand, and he could read some of my stuff. 

Alexis: Where'd you learn shorthand? 

Ruth: Where'd I learn? 

Alexis: Yeah, was it from your job? 

Ruth: High school. High school, that's right.

I did a lot of shorthand. 

Tom: 120 words a minute. 

Alexis: Do you still know how to do it? 

Ruth: I know I left it go.

I really wish I wouldn't have. I wish I would have stuck with writing my notes in shorthand, but I do remember some of the, a couple of the characters that you'd use to write. 

Alexis: Was that common to learn in high school? 

Ruth: Well, you either went academic or you went commercial, and so there were other, you know, we had classes in commercial, we had classes in academic.

Alexis: What, I guess, what is that, what's the difference? Like, what would academic mean for, like, high school, and what would commercial mean for high school? 

Ruth: Well, like the commercial, you took shorthand, you did typing, you did bookkeeping, and if you were going on to college, you didn't take those three things, at least. I mean, I still had, before, that was only 11th and 12th grade. 9th and 10th, they were just all the same classes.

(46:46 - 47:39)
Alexis: So, academic would be, like, college track, and then commercial would be workforce, like, entering the workforce track. So, I guess, during this time period, I know you mentioned that it was kind of maybe an expectation that women that were married wouldn't work, but was there an expectation that you would, upon graduating, that you would, like, while you were unmarried, you would work? 

Ruth: Uh, well, yes, I was, yes. If I was out of school and I was not married, how did I keep, what, support myself? Sure, I had to have a job.

Tom: You worked during your last year, last half year of high school. 

Ruth: Well, the last month of high school, I went to school in the morning, I worked in the afternoon, and I made up schoolwork at night. My mother said she'd never let anybody do that again.

(47:43 - 52:19)
Alexis: Why? 

Ruth: I don't know. I guess it was probably, like, making up the schoolwork in the evening, and going to schools, and I didn't wear, we wore uniforms to school, but when I had to go to work that last month, I had to go to work in the afternoon, I didn't wear a uniform to school, because I went from, I guess, I went from school to work, and then home, and then I had to do schoolwork at home. Yeah.

Alexis: Anything else you'd like to say? 

Ruth: I will say Jim Roscoe, the fella bachelor from up the road, he would come down and get our, your mother and her, your uncle, and he would take them up to his house. I could not, didn't know what the attraction was, but he asked me at one time, he said he wanted to take Dana up, which of course meant I had to go along to take her, so we did, and then it was like, oh my gosh, now I know why the kids like to come up here. He had a huge meadow behind his house that he kept mowed, and there was a creek that the kids could play in, there were trees that they could climb, and so it was like, and then I saw her look, What?

Tom: It looked like a park.

Ruth: Yeah, it was, so then it was like, oh, this is why they like to come up here, because they didn't have to worry about traffic, they were protected, they were behind, down in behind his house. They could have, if there had been a group of them, like a baseball game or something, it was a large area, and so I saw the look on your face when I wondered why, what the attraction was. Back then, in those days, I never would have thought anything wrong, and he was a good man, and he, um, I think he found some homey friendship with us and our family.

Tom: He was dad's friend. 

Ruth: His dad's friend. 

Tom: Because their parents lived on that hill, Jim's parents lived on that hill, down there where that meadow was, and the house was gone already by the time I, when I was a kid and went up there.

The house was gone; the only thing left was the foundation. He had eighteen acres of ground. 

Alexis: Did you used to play in that field as a kid, too? 

Tom: Yeah, dad and I would go up there to his house, and Jim was building the house, and dad put the ridge pole up in the rafters, and this was an enormous house.

It was like thirty-seven feet wide and fifty feet long, stone cased, 

Alexis: So, was Jim your dad's age? 

Tom: Yeah, they were the same age. I don't know which one was six months older. 

Alexis: So, he would have been like my mom's grandfather's age, so he kind of would have been like a grandfatherly figure for them.

Ruth: Or an uncle or something. 

Tom: And everybody on the hill, no matter who, relatives or not, was aunt and uncle, grandma, and grandpa, even if they weren't your grandma and grandpa. But that was how we showed respect.

Alexis: I guess we should probably say Pap is the term our family uses for grandfather. 

Ruth: When I was growing up on my side, it was aunt and uncle. We called the neighbors aunt and uncle.

Now all children are just called adults by their first name. I know I went to introduce, I don't know, maybe it was you, to a lady friend of mine that stopped here at the house, and I was, and she could tell, I guess I was hesitant how to introduce you, because I like I didn't want to say, you know, but she popped up and she said, 'Miss Dorothy.' I thought that was good way for young children, just like Miss or Mr., their first name.

(52:22 - 53:19)
Alexis: Did you guys feel like you balanced like being a parent and then like having a personal life, or was it mostly just being a parent? Like how did you? 

Tom: Well, by bootstraps. 

Ruth: It was mostly 

Tom: work. 

Ruth: Mostly our duties, obligation.

What we were expected to do, we did. We didn't have much of a social. We did some things.

We were involved in some things, but I don't know what you, how would I say that. 

Alexis: I guess this might be a kind of a nebulous question. Where did the expectations come from, do you think? Like "we did what we were expected to do," was it? 

Tom: It's what you saw at home.

(53:20 - 53:32)
Alexis: So, from your parents? 

Tom: Because you were growing up there, that's what you saw. 

Ruth: Yeah, I guess so. Yeah, I guess, you know, my father worked 42 years for the same company.

(53:33 - 56:55)
Ruth: My mother was the homemaker. I prefer to say homemaker versus housewife, because I'm not a wife to the house, you know. That doesn't sound as good to me.

I think a home; you're making a home. You're doing. 

Tom: You kept everything together.

Ruth: It's like when we moved, we didn't move our house. We moved our home. We took our home with us.

Alexis: So, I guess you guys, so as by your own words, you didn't have much of a social life while you had the children. What was being empty nesters like for you then? Like this thing you spent almost all your time on, what did you guys, how did you guys adjust to that? 

Tom: I don't know. The kids are here until they were twenty-eight.

Ruth: Right, we had them around, but Uncle Chris, he kind of came home from work and went to his bedroom and that and got to the point where Pap said to me, you know, quit waiting supper for him, because a lot of times he wouldn't eat anyhow. So we were, so to speak, adapting to that while we were together.

But when he retired, it took me about, I would say, about two years to adapt to him being around. 

Alexis: Him being Pap? 

Ruth: Pardon? 

Alexis: Him being Pap? 

Ruth: Pap being Pap, yeah. Part of, I remember saying to him a lot of time in the early, earlier time, and I said to him, you talk a lot.

I was used to being at home here by myself. You talk a lot. I didn't realize that about him until he was around.

Alexis: How long had you been married at that point? 

Ruth: I don't remember. What was that? I'd say fifty-seven minus 10, which was pushing 30 years.

Alexis: You didn't know he talked a lot? 

Ruth: No, he was busy building a house and we were busy with this and busy with this and this and that. 

Tom: Working on cars. 

Ruth: And yes, the cars, you know, he always was helping out with cars.

Tom: Helping out somebody else.

Ruth: And so, yeah, I wasn't alone here much with him like during the day and all that. Yeah, you talk a lot.

Alexis: I'm sure being retired was nice. 

Ruth: Pardon? 

Alexis: I'm sure being retired was nice. Like, it was nice to be able to have more time.

Tom: For a couple years, though, it felt bad in as much as, like you had to go to work. It was hard getting accustomed to staying in the house for a couple years. 

Alexis: So, 

Tom: You didn't have an obligation to go, go someplace, punch a clock.

Alexis: It felt like you needed to still go to work? 

Tom: Yeah. We don't have that anymore. 

Ruth: I think that's the first I'm hearing now.

(56:56 - 57:01)
Ruth: Or else I just don't remember him saying that before. 

Alexis: Okay.
