## About This Item

This photograph is of Tom and Ruth's house on Dishong Road in Johnstown, Pennsylvania.

## From the Contributor

Tom Demko constructed this house himself with help from family and the community. They moved into the house before it was completed, in 1970. When they moved in there were not kitchen cabinets, and the only sink they had for six months was in the laundry room. 

The house was on well water, it would stain the clothes when they washed them. In the beginning they had temporary electricity. They had a fuse pole outside, but there wasn't enough power in the ten fuses on the pole to run a house. It took years to get everything done, they think around 1974.
