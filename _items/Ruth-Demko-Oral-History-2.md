## Interview Summary

Ruth grew up in downtown Johnstown. She doesn't recall the city ever being as busy or discordent as up on the mountains surrounding the city where she one day moved. People on the mountain had share telephone lines, and people would listen in on one anothers convesations. Ruth didn't like this, and insisted on having a private line. It took six months for it to be installed.

She worked for an attorney before she was married. She and Tom did not want her to work after she was married and she planned only to work for six months after. However, this didn't happen because she was let go. She does not know for certain, but she guesses that she was let go because her boss did not want a married woman working in his office. She says that this was a common understanding, and she says it might be because of old school ideas that women belong at home.

Ruth Demko was interviewed by her granddaughter Alexis Shoulta at here gome in Greenwood, Indiana, on December 2, 2025. This interview is a follow up interview to Ruth Demko Oral History 1, collected on October 5, 2025.

Throughout the interview, Ruth's husband Tom is referred to as "Pap." This is the familial term that his grandchildren call him.

As a hommemaker Ruth's jobs at home were to take care of the children, cook, clean and take care of her mother. When her children were in school, she would wake up, get them ready and make them breakfast. When they got older, she didn't have to do as much, and would listen to see if they were on task and then would be with them at the door when they left. Once the kids were at school, her day was comprised of taking care of her daughter, Dana. 

Dana's daily care was dependent upon her physical state of the day. Some days Ruth would have to perform "percussion"  on her or would give her medication. Percussion was where Ruth would tap on Dana's chest when she had pneumonia to break up buildup in her lungs. Dana could not cough on her own, and she had pneumonia over twenty one times. Ruth would also physically set her up to play, and changed her dipers. 

Dana was educated at home. There was a program called Appalachia Intermediate Unit 8. They provided teachers to come to the home to teach her several times a week. The last year she was alive, she was doing first-grade course work. The school district had wanted to send a school teacher to come to the house to work with Dana after he finished his school days. Ruth objected to this, because Dana would be too tired by that time of the day. So she had to continue with the Appalachia Unit 8, but the teacher sourced her curriculum from the local school. 

When the family would go out, they took her everywhere. They also traveled with her. Tom built Dana a wheelchair from a stroller, and it was able to fold down so they could travel with it as well. The Muscular Dystrophy Association was willing to buy her a wheelchair, but at the time they could not find one that met Dana's needs. There were not ramps, so Tom would pick up her chair to move her up and down steps. At home, Dana slept upstairs and she needed to be carried up and down the stairs as well.

They avoided people that they knew to be sick. The only class she took with other children was her religious education courses. Ruth recalls that Dana was thrilled to be able to be around the other students. They also took Dana to be treated at the NIH at the National Institutes of Neurological Disease and Stroke. Pittsburgh Children's Hospital sent a neurologist to their local hospital every six months for muscular dystrophy.

When Ruth cooked or baked, it was from scratch. When Tom came home from work, the family would have their evening meal. As the years went on, Ruth really wanted to get the kids bathed and to bed in the evening. Tom was responsible for getting the kids bathed and ready for bed, and it was then that she was able to sit and relax and drink coffee. Then the family would all say nightly prayers together.

When Tom was unemployed he would get up in the mornings and take care of Dana so that she could sleep in. He would get Dana set up to watch her TV show. They would also like to play Uno together. He also worked on building their house during the layoff. She was not able to return to work or bring in alternate forms of income when Tom was laid off because Dana needed her care. If she went back to work, Tom would have to take over as Dana's primary caretaker, and the house wouldn't have been able to be built. However, Ruth didn't really want to return to work, she was content with homemaking.

Ruth recalls that during the layoffs they were aware that it was bad in the area. Tom would hear about if someone was hired somewhere and then would apply the same places.

Tom started having to commute further and further from home to get work. He got a job working in York, Pennsylvania and would be gone for the whole week and come home on the weekeneds. He travelled and lived in a boarding house with another man from their area that was doing the same thing. Ruth recalls that there were no other options for work. They did not move to be with him because he was not at the jobs for very long, and some of the companies were going out of business. It would have been financially unfeasable to keep moving themselves. After York, Tom began working in Terre Haute, Indiana in 1984. For a year he would come home one weekend every three weeks.

Ruth says these times were hard. Their children needed their father, and she needed her husband. It could be lonely for her without him. She had to adapt to doing work that he would have done and sometimes had to rely on her son. After the first year of Tom working in Terre Haute, the company wanted him to continue working there and the family made the decision to move. They felt that the job was secure enough to warrant it. However, only a few months after the move Tom ended up being laid off again. So Tom started commuting an hour and a half each way to Indianapolis.

When Tom was commuting this way it was better for her that he was home, however he would go to work come home and go straight to bed.

When Tom was laid off the would budget their money, and sometimes cut back on food to save money. Sometimes they used envelopes as a method of managing their money. She cooked pasta and would make three meals out of a single chicken. She says at the time she just did what she had to do. She tried to make things from scratch because it was cheapers. When asked if liked to cook she expresses that it was her job and she just did it because it was what women did. She says she didn't think about it any other way.

The family got some food from the government like cheese and butter, and the children would get reduced and eventually free. They tried to get utilities assistance but they didn't qualify because the reviewed their income from three months before when Tom was still working. They also attempted to get SSI for Dana, but did not qualify for it because they would have had to have virtually no assets. Even if they had qualified, they would deduct one fifth of Tom's unemployment.

Ruth was not taught how to cook or clean by her mother. Although her mother did do these jobs, she says her mother didn't teach her because she was out of the home working. Instead, Ruth learned from recipe books, and trial and error. She says she was able to learn easily and did not struggle. 

Ruth was at one time treasurer of the PTA. When she was serving, the whole family would go, because it was dangerous to drive nack up the mountain at night. There were not street lights or houses. She and Tom also joined the Compassionate Friends, a support group for grieving parents after Dana died, 

The family moved to Greenwood in 1987 after their oldest daughter Karen graduated high school. 

Ruth identifies her husband's career as stabilizing only when he retired. Ruth did not think that her and Tom would be able to have a good retirement. She told her oldest granddaughter that she used to think the would be eating dog food. There were many years where they were unable to save money. After they finished paying off their children's college expenses they saved as much as they could while Tom was still working.

Before they were married, Tom told Ruth that he believed if someone didn't have the money to pay cash for something they couldn't afford it. Ruth didn't have a problem with this because she was the type of person too. Even before she was married she would save her money.

When they first got married, Tom would keep his patcheck. And one time, he brought home his next check and the first one was still untouched. For a while, Tom managed the finances alone, and it didn't work well. Then Ruth managed them alone and it also didn't work well. They tried doing them together and didn't like that either, so managing the money came back to solely being Ruth's job.

Ruth currently lives with her husband Tom in Greenwood, Indiana.
