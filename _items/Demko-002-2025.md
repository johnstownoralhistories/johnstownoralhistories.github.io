Alexis Shoulta: July 30 or 31st of 2025, it was taken by St. Barnabas, it was by St. Barnabas or was it some photo studio for St. Barnabas? 

(0:17 - 0:28)
Ruth Demko : It was a studio, it was a place that goes around and takes pictures for pictorials for churches. And they'll publish a book. It was supposed to be done by the end of October and we haven't received it yet.

(0:28 - 0:36)
Ruth: But we'll have one of those pictorial books with all the different pictures in it. 

Alexis: It's a parish directory, right? Yeah. Okay.

(0:37 - 0:54)
Tom Demko: One of those with the names and addresses and nothing else. It's just like a phone directory.
