## Interview Summary
This interview was Collected by Alexis Shoulta December 2, 2025. It is a continuation of Tom Demko Oral History 1 that was collected on October 5, 2025. 

Tom was a draftsman and he first learned drafting as a high school math credit course. He went to Indiana Teachers College in Pennsylvania. He had to sit out a semester because of his GPA, so he went to Chicago Technical College to take drafting courses. He completed the two year course in eight months.

In Chicago Tom boarded with a woman named Mrs. Sievers. It cost 25 dollars a week, but he also would work for her and sometimes didn't have to pay. She and her family were post-war immigrants from Germany. Her husband, Werner was captured and tortured during the war, and couldn't work. So, Mrs. Sievers was the breadwinner of the family and made money by cleaning houses and eventually housing boarders. Eventually, the property they owned included three houses, a lake cottage and a boat. The mortgage was valued at 500,000 in 1964. Her three sons were drafted by the U.S. Military. Mrs. Sievers and Tom were very close, and he says that she treated them as if they were family. Eventually, Tom and Ruth visited her on their honeymoon. 

While living in Chicago he got a job where he started at minimum wage, 1.35 an hour. He got five raises in nine weeks. Each raise was a nickle more an hour. He would get three days pay, and he was saving his money to go to the Illinois Institute of Technology. He switched jobs again and worked his wages up to 350 dollars a month, and took night classes at IIT. However, he was drafted into the army and was sent to Fort Knox in Kentucky for basic training. He did well on his tests for the army.

During basic training Tom applied for Officers Candidate School. Based on how many years of math he had in high school determined he would be in the artillary over the infantry. He was sent to the Brooklyn Navy Yard. There he worked in the bakery. He would bring the other men snacks and food from his job for them to eat. They travelled by ship from Brooklyn to Hamburg. From there they went to Frankfurt am Main to Hanau to a base he does not recall the name of. The had nuclear weapons. He was in an honest john rocket battalion. They guarded the Fulda Gap against the Soviet Union during the Cold War. He recalls being given c-rations leftover from World War II. He also shared his strategies for utilizing his leave time.

In the military he traveled to 20 countries during the 19 months he was in Europe. After his time in the military he returned to Pennsylvania and lived with his family.

At U.S. Steel, Tom was a detail draftsman and when he moved to Allstate he moved up to becoming a designer. He worked for them for a little over a year before there was a cutback. He took a 15% pay cut. His pay started at 13 dollars an hour, while the men working on the shop floor made five dollars an hour. This went on until he was eventually totally laid off.

At the employment office he was told to take a lower job than what he was qualified to do. He then worked two days a week for five dollars an hour. He was still able to collect unemployment because he worked so little. One time while he was unemployed he was told he had to sign a form at a company to show that he went for an interview. On these forms he was asked about how many people were in his household rather than his skills.

He travelled to Florida for 3 days to do 11 interviews. At one interview he was told to transfer his engineering credidation and he would for sure have a job, however Tom wasn't a profrassional engineer, so he missed out on the job.

After that he went to York, Pennsylvania for work. The job was supposed to pay eleven dollars an hour, however, the job only paid 8 dollars and ten cents. He stayed as a boarder during the week while working in York. He would drive straight back to Johnstown from work on Fridays for the weekend.

The next job he got through a connection with a friend. It was located in Terre Haute, Indiana and it paid thirteen dollars an hour and per diem. His family continued to live in Johnstown, and he commuted back and forth between there and Terre Hauted. He would go back to Johnstown for one weekend every three weeks. In Terre Haute he worked for J.I. Case he was laid off in October. The company found him another job at an alluminum company in his neighborhood. He worked there for two weeks before getting another job at Allison Engine Company in Indianapolis. There he made fifteen dollars an hour without per diem. That job was 75 miles one way from Terre Haute.

When Tom lived alone in Terre Haute lived on fifteen to twenty dollars a week. He would get fried chicken and fries at K-mart for dinners.To distract from being away from his family, he liked to keep himself as busy as possible to distract himself. He would help people with odd jobs, and handyman work. He also would travel to Chicago to visit with Mrs. Sievers during this time, as they remained friends. He says during these times he felt always stressed, and he attributes diabetes he developed as a result of this stress.

He commuted with his friend Amos to Indianapolis for work. They met working at J.I. Case. Amos is African American and he experienced prejudice within the industry. For example, Tom's coworkers would question that he would allow Amos to drive his car. Together they would sometimes pick up hitchhikers.

His wife, Ruth was in charge of the finances in their household. She kept his paycheck, and would  be responsible for cashing them. Ruth didn't work, and Tom didn't want her to work. He felt that he was making enough money. He says that he thought he would climb the ladder, and have his pension in his 50s. However, the closures disrupted this plan.

While Tom was unemployed he worked on constructing their house, and he recalls a lot of the specific details of the construction. He bought the plans for the house from the Pittsbugh Press for seven dollars, and modified the plans to suit the family's needs. Sometimes when he was unemployed in a workplace with a union, he would get subpay from the union. It would be about 65% of their original pay. During the interview Ruth spoke up to say that, one time when they were on unemployment, she was planning on the sub pay starting, and she was looking forward ton money being less tight. However, the church had a fundraiser and Tom donated the entirety of a sub payment. It upset Ruth deeply.

Tom had various health issues. He got cancer while he was in his 30s. He had to take some time off for radiation treatment and eventually surgery. However, eventually returned to working part time and eventually full-time. They got full pay when he was unable to work from the treatment. He was diagnosed as diabetic at 49.

After Tom retired he felt restless without work. So again, he distracted himself with always having a task to do to be busy. Ruth chimed in to add that Tom used to say that he would do all the housework when he retired, however, that didn't quite turn out how she expected. Today he does a lot of the housework for her though.

Tom currently lives in Greenwood, Indiana with his wife Ruth.

## Transcript

Thoughout this interview Ruth Demko is occasionally referred to by the nickname "Glammy".

(0:00 - 0:42)
Tom Demko: My name is Thomas Demko. 

Alexis Shoulta: And you are my, Alexa Shoulta's 

Tom: grandfather. 

Alexis: Thank you for being willing to share your experience with me today. 

As I previously mentioned, this study aims to collect oral histories and recollections of deindustrialization in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. I am studying the impact of changes in the work environment on families and people's life experiences. Our interview today should last approximately an hour. 

I'm going to ask you a series of questions about your family and experiences with steel in Johnstown. This interview is being recorded for oral history preservation and historical analysis purposes. If you need to take a break at any time, let me know, and I can pause the recording and interview. 

We'll go back over your consent form at the end of the interview to review and confirm your previous choices. 

Tom: Okay. 

Alexis: Okay.

(0:44 - 3:38)
Tom: The only thing that I'll add to what Ruthie was saying previously that on the finances, um, the first job shop I had was through my boss at U.S. Steel. And I wound up, uh, working for Allstate's design and development. And, uh, from U.S. Steel, I got, went from a detail draftsman up about four steps to a design, designer. 

And some of the questions that they asked at this job is how you, uh, calculate the, uh, end radius on steel, uh, because they were making heat pump equipment. And it was one-third the thickness of the steel added up to the radius, uh, for figuring out the length of the piece of steel that you were making for the part. Um, I worked for that company, uh, a little over a year and they had a cutback. 

And at the time the cutback came, I had to take a 15% cut in pay. Uh, the fellows out in the shop were getting five bucks an hour. I think I started there at $13 an hour. 

And this went on, uh, until the fall when I got, uh, laid off, uh, permanent type thing. Uh, didn't know when I was going back there. So, at the employment office, they said, you got to take a lower class job. 

But I was doing everything from running the prints through the design. I was the only draftsman really there, engineer, well, they had other engineers. But, uh, anyhow, I said, uh, do you, would you like me to work one day a week for 10 bucks an hour or two days a week for five bucks an hour? And they jumped it to five bucks an hour, which was a real small amount of money. 

But I still could be able to affect unemployment because I'd only be working, uh, two days a week. Uh, which this built up over the 26 weeks that you normally get on unemployment. So, this would give me maybe 30, 35 weeks of, uh, unemployment that I could, uh, get. 

One time when I was, uh, unemployed and they said, you have to sign up, uh, with the company, uh, to show that you were there for an interview. And they had a tablet on the countertop and they said, just sign your name. And some of the questions they'd ask you if they were, uh, uh, working with the state a little bit, they'd say, well, how many people besides your family are you keeping in your household? It wasn't how much you knew or what you could do or anything like that.

(3:39 - 4:06)
Tom: And this was in most of the cases in Pennsylvania for me. Uh, we went to Florida for, uh, three days. I had 11 interviews. 

One of the interviews, the fellow told me, just transfer your PE professional engineer seal to me down here and you got a job. Well, I was just a detailed draftsman. I was sent out to laborers before where he thought I was, where I was working before.

(4:06 - 5:51)
Tom: And of course, I didn't get that job because I wasn't a professional engineer. After that, uh, I went to York, Pennsylvania, and it was supposed to be 11 hour, $11 an hour job as a layout man. And it turned out to be an $8.10 an hour detail, uh, detail job. 

And we'd pay Amy $38 a week. And Walt and I would... 

Alexis: Who was Amy? 

Tom: Amy was the lady, retired school teacher that owned this farm, and she would take renters in. And we would uh, get in there Saturday night, Sunday, uh, Monday, Sunday night, uh, Monday morning, we'd pack our lunches, go to work. 

Uh, we'd do that until Friday. Uh, Friday, we packed our lunches and straight from work, we'd head back to Johnstown for our wives for $38 a week. It was cheap. 

And I think about the second or third week, I told Ruthie that, uh, we're going to be draining our kids' college funds and, uh, we can't keep doing this. But we had an insurance man at, uh, for New York Life that would come and talk with us quite often. And anyhow, uh, where he lived, he took his next door neighbor's daughter to the Pittsburgh airport from Johnstown. 

And she says, Mike, if you ever need anything, just ask. So a couple weeks later, he thought, I'm going to go do this, call for Tom. So he called her up and she said, Mike who? And Mike was a good talker.

(5:51 - 9:21)
Tom: And anyhow, I got a job that was $13 an hour plus per diem in Terre Haute. And that worked out as Ruthie had said previously. Uh, we worked, I worked there for four months and got laid off in October. 

And J.I. Case was a great company with the people there. They, uh, tried to find me a job and somebody did find me one at an aluminum company in the neighborhood. Worked there for two weeks with manpower and then got a, uh, another job shop, job at, for Allison Engine Company, GEM, in Indianapolis. 

That was 75 miles one way. Uh, started there in, uh, October, November, and Amos got laid off in January. And Amos and I started riding up there. 

GM wouldn't hire Amos, but Lilly's hired Amos. And... 

Alexis: Was that because, because Amos was black? 

Tom: Yeah, Amos was, uh, African American and we were friends. I would jump out of the car on, uh, Tibb's and Amos would drive my car over to Lilly's because it was further away. 

And guys saw this and they said, 'you're letting Amos drive your car?' 'Yeah,' I said, 'what? Amos is Amos.' Uh, there's a lot of prejudice against black people, but I never felt that. I felt good. 

Uh, but anyhow, we used to pick hitchhikers up and we would give them the change out of the, uh, from whenever we bought gas. We didn't have credit cards at that time. And the change left over from the gasoline bill, we would hand it to these guys. 

One time we picked up a, uh, fellow that was, uh, heading for Arizona and he said he actually, back east, he was a good talker. He talked, uh, better talk when he got in and found out Amos and I were Christians. And he, uh, changed his speaking just automatically like that from, he turned off the light and it became dark. 

Uh, anyhow, he had a, uh, a policeman in, uh, Silver Spring, Maryland driving eight miles out of his district. Yeah, that's how good of a talker he was. And he told us all kinds of stories and he had us in stitches. 

He says 'whenever you're down and out and you can't afford, uh, a warm place to stay, you look at the nice hotels, go in and go up to the counter and tell the guy, I'm going to sit over there in that chair for 30 minutes and I'm going to leave.' And he says, 'what you do is you watch the elevator come down. And when the fella comes down with a bimbo and he ducks the keys into the ashtray, uh, when they get out of sight, you go over there and take the key out. You've got a good warm place to sleep, sleep that night.' 

And he says, uh, usually, uh, Kentucky Fried Chicken. He says, 'you go in here just 30 minutes before closing time and, uh, tell the lady, I'm destitute. Could you pack the, uh, excess chicken and french fries, put them in a bag, put them in the dumpster. I'll pick them up after you close.' So he says, 'you can eat well and sleep well, but you just have to know how to do it.'

(9:23 - 18:18)
Tom: Um, and with what, uh, the finances, Ruthie took care of her, everything. When I, uh, worked at, uh, BFY in York, uh, she got the checks, uh, she cashed them. Uh, when I worked for All States, uh, they sent them to the house. 

One time she accidentally ripped off the check, but they issued another one. Uh, and when I worked in Terre Haute, uh, CDI was the, uh, I think the job shop company, and they just mailed them to Ruthie. Uh, and Ruthie gave me the checkbook. 

I had a checkbook, uh, in Terre Haute, and I would live on $15, $20 a week. And, you know, I'd get down to Kmart on Wednesday, they had fried chicken special, and, uh, the ladies there were, you could tell they were making minimum wage, and I would slip them a tip, and I said, 'oh, if you happen to have any chicken breasts that are fried, I'd appreciate that.' So my dinner consisted, it was all you could eat. 

It was all chicken, and, uh, french fries, or, uh, quartered potatoes, or, and a vegetable. 

Alexis: Um, so, sorry not to jump around a bit, but, um, did you say you worked for Allison in Indianapolis? 

Tom: Yeah, Allison Engine Company. 

Alexis: Did you work at the factory by the, um, the racetrack? 

Tom: No, this was located at Tibbs and, um, Raymond. 

It was on the, uh, north side of that. That was Plant 8. Plant 5 is where the production, where they manufactured the engines. That was Plant 5, and that was on the south side of Tibbs off of the east side of Tibbs, south of Raymond. 

Alexis: And Amos worked for Lilly? 

Tom: Amos worked for Lilly, yes. 

Alexis: And you guys would commute? How did you end up, um, meeting and commuting with Amos? 

Tom: Uh, somehow, oh, over Christmas time, I guess they had, uh, planned shutdown, and anyhow, uh, Amos gave me a call, uh, because, uh, J.I. Case was moving to Wisconsin, and only some of the people were asked to go. 

Alexis: So you both worked at the same company originally? 

Tom: Down in Terre Haute, yes. 

Alexis: Okay. Um, and then, how, so how did you end up becoming a draftsman? 

Tom: Oh, uh, when I was in high school, it was, I think, the first year that they offered, uh, uh, drafting, and I had four years in math, and, uh, drafting was the fifth credit. And now, going back after that, uh, high school went to Indiana State Teachers College, Indiana, Pennsylvania, and anyhow, I was asked to sit out a semester, because my grade point was 1.6. 

Uh, so I don't smoke. My dad doesn't smoke, but somehow, we happened to get a, uh, matchbook, and we had, from Chicago Technical College, 145 bucks for, uh, a two-year drafting course, and you got five, uh, free classes, and they said 90% of the people they found jobs for. So during this, uh, uh, being away from Indiana State Teachers College, uh, I took the course, and, uh, the two-year course I completed in eight and a half months with an A average, and I headed for Chicago in the fall, and, uh, stayed at the YMCA the first night when I got there. Uh, Monday morning, I went down to the college and registered, took, uh, three math courses in industrial organization and psychology and industry, and I got two, three As and two Bs in those courses, and, uh, they gave me, uh, address for Mrs. Sievers' boarding house on the near north side. 

So I, two transfers, and on the bus, and it took me three hours lugging a suitcase to get there. That was $25 a week for room and board, and she wanted $25 in advance, and that was good, and we were negotiating. Some fella came in the door, and she says, 'are they hiring out where you're working?' He says, 'yeah.' 

So I went out there the next day in my suit, and they weren't taking applications that day, but I was in a suit and tie. I went back the next day. I was the only one that was hired. 

They were hiring the next day. I got five raises in nine weeks. I started out minimum wage of $1.35 an hour, and each raise was a nickel an hour, and that was, that African American is the only supervisor I had that I, I couldn't comprehend him ahead of time. 

Everybody else I had figured out, but anyhow, uh, things were slow in 62, and they shut down. Uh, of course, they got paid for Thanksgiving to employees, and if you were there three months or more. What was it, six months, and they gave Friday off. 

Everybody took a day off without pay, so I only got three days pay, and I was saving my money to go to Illinois Institute of Technology after my courses at Chicago Technical College, and anyhow, I jumped ship right after that and went to a headhunter, and that was $1,200 for a job, and I had five jobs in six months and got my wages up to $350 a month, and, uh, after the courses at Illinois Institute of Technology, uh, let's see, that was the third night school, third semester night school, uh, Friday night class was over, and Monday morning, I was Pittsburgh ahead for Fort Knox, uh, Kentucky for basic training, and basic training was 13 weeks. 

Alexis: Did you join the army, or were you drafted? 

Tom: I was drafted. Uh, well, previously, I had to take tests down, uh, downtown Indian-, uh, Chicago someplace. 

I can't remember where it was, but there was a black fellow to the right of me, and he wanted to get in so bad, but he didn't have the knowledge, and somehow, between one of the, one of the tests that were taken, he told me his situation, and I let him look at my papers. Uh, I did very, very well on the army tests except for the, uh, uh, tele, telegraph stuff. They had L, M, and N, I think, or K, L, and N, and I think I got an 86 on that. 

Everything else was over 120. Yeah. Anyhow, after basic training, uh, we had a second lieutenant that was, uh, went through OCS. 

He was 19 years old. This is July, Fort Knox, and you don't want to be there going through basic training, because we had guys falling over left and right. They're giving salt tablets. 

The, uh, first class sergeant, uh, grabbed a hold of the second lieutenant, put him in the office, and told him to stay there, and he took over, and he, he saved a, uh, training, uh, company. After that, uh, anyhow, I saw what was going on, and this guy went through OCS. He's 19 years old. 

We were 22, and there was, oh, about 40, 50 guys that had some college and ROTC and whatever. So, we said, hey, let's apply for OCS. So, they'd pick out one guy, march us over. 

We'd fill out papers, pick out a different guy, march us back, and we missed a lot of the training. I didn't get shot. I did crawl under the barbed wire, uh, barbed wire when they fired the machine guns over your head, uh, when we went out, uh, map reading.

(18:18 - 22:22)
I was good at map reading, because I had some of that in college. 

Alexis: What was OCS? 

Tom: Officers Candidate School. Sorry. 

So, anyhow, we get out there, and they dump us off in the truck, eight o'clock in the morning, and they said, you got to use the metrics and get to wherever, and, uh, the trouble when you run through this obstacle course, the truck will pick you up. So, anyhow, I looked at all the stuff that was on there, and they said, they're going to pick us up on top of the hill. We're not going to do all this stuff. 

It's a waste of time, which it was. Anyhow, we got out of the woods when we saw the truck get there, and we hopped on and went back, but, uh, basic training was sort of easy, but what happened? I was supposed to go to Fort Lee, Virginia engineering because of my scores, and anyhow, they took all of us guys that were for OCS and dropped out. They put us up, lined us up on the field, and anyhow, they said, all you guys that haven't had, uh, four years of math in high school, take two steps backwards. 

All you guys that did have four years, I had five, uh, take two steps forward. All you guys in the back or in the infantry, all you guys at the front are the artillery. So, I wound up going to Fort Knox, uh, Oklahoma Artillery School. 

So, I, uh, did very well there, and anyhow, wound up going to Brooklyn Navy Yard. Got a flight to Brooklyn, my first airplane flight. Uh, anyhow, we get on, uh, USS Maurice Rose, and there's some guy said, 'oh, we're going on a cruise ship. They can't give us any job,' and I figured, you're dumber than a monkey. So, I went looking for my job. I worked to get a job in a bakery. 

So, anyhow, uh, I only had spaghetti and powdered milk at Brooklyn, in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, and never tasted such terrible food. Once I got on ship, it, uh, anchors away, uh, I would come back at night, and I would dump out cakes, and mixed nuts, and apples, and oranges, and all the goodies that I could, cookies that I could, yeah, I'd confiscate, laid it out on the bed. 'Okay, guys, come get them'. 

Alexis: Were you stealing it from the military? 

Tom: No. Military guys, I just moved it from one place to another. So, we got over there, uh, anyhow, the first sergeant was understaffed. 

He was 40 percent understaffed, and he traded two guys for me, which, boy, that was a big mistake, I used to say, because I was the first guy that sat down in the orderly room. Oh, the guys always went out on the street. They had to be back by 10 o'clock there, uh, drinking the German beer, 16, 17 percent alcohol. 

Uh, me, I get down to the orderly room. I read, read two, eight and a half, eleven books that were six inches thick that were the Army regulations. I was the first guy that went on a religious retreat from that unit, and, uh, I think the first sergeant had to ask the company clerk, what is that? 

Alexis: Can I, uh, can I qualify for a second? So, you took, the ship you took, it took you to Germany? 

Tom: Yeah. 

Alexis: Okay. 

Tom: The Hamburg, uh, uh, I guess it was Hamburg, and then we had a ride down to, was in Frankfurt am Main to Hanau to, uh, can't remember the base anymore. Lost it. 

It was a, they had nuclear weapons there. We had an honest, it was an honest John Rocket Battalion. But every time we went out, uh, well, the first time I really remember going out is going to Grafenwoehr, where they had live ammo fire, and firings, uh, both from the eight-inch to 155s and the honest John Rocket.

(22:24 - 24:24)
Tom: And anyhow, they gave us C-rations from 1942. This is 1960, uh, late 62, early 63. Forty-year-old C-rations in cans. 

Cookie's throwing stuff out. 'Hey, Cookie, could I have that what you're throwing out?' So, I have a C-ration box, and I just throw them in, and we had a band, because I figured someplace along the line, somebody's going to use that stuff. And there were many alerts, and I used to tell guys, if you're going, if they're, if you're on leave, check out five minutes after midnight, because they can't get you on an alert. 

There was one fellow who would get out of bed at 10 o'clock. He wound up on alert by the time he washed his equipment. He lost a whole day of leave time. 

I would sign out five minutes after midnight, come back in five minutes before midnight. Five minutes before midnight was not a day of leave. It was a day of work, duty. 

But there's a lot of things I learned in the military. I got free flights to England twice, Spain, Norway. I flew into, got into 20 countries in Europe in 19 months, and it was a godsend. 

I think God was with me all the time. Our battery had the most accurate on-the-stone rocket firing. It was three meters off it, and it had a range of 26 miles. 

We were supposed to guard the Fulda Gap in case the communists came. And guard duty was, we had the nuke site, and it would be two hours on, four hours off, 

Alexis: Are you allowed to reveal this? 

Tom: two hours on, four hours on. I always took the last one so that I didn't have to clean up the guardhouse.

(24:26 - 24:48)
Alexis: How long were you in the military for?

Tom: A couple days short of two years. When I got out, there wasn't any place that they could assign me to, so I had six years without any military duty, and after that I got my military honorable discharge. 

Alexis: And then you went back to being a draftsman? 

Tom: Yeah, I went back to the company I was leaving.

(24:48 - 25:17)
Tom: I was making $350 a month, and they jacked it up to $400. And my dad kept wanting me to go back to Johnstown. Anyhow, Jim Roscoe worked in the accounting office, and he knew some engineer. 

And anyhow, all the stuff that I knew, they got me a job there. That was $3 an hour, which was $500 and some dollars a month. I was making a lot of money.

(25:18 - 25:42)
Tom: And I stayed at home. I used to save $100 a week. I got paid every two weeks, I guess. 

Every two weeks. I used to save $200, I guess, out of that. And then... I used my dad's car. 

Well, my dad drove. My mother didn't drive, and dad had a truck and a car. So I had the use of the car.

(25:43 - 26:35)
Alexis: How did your... I guess I'd say, how did your relationship with work, in terms of time, change before and after you got married? 

Tom: How did it change? At one time, I went in and asked the boss for a raise, because I figured I was a harder worker than everybody there. And he said, well, you belong to the union, and they give you a cost of living raise. I had the cancer there, and that was sick leave. 

And everybody except me realized that I had to go back to work, that I was... I don't know. What's the word I want to use love? Staying at home and bored of something. 

Ruth Demko: I'm not sure what you mean, everybody wanted you to go back to work after the cancer.

(26:35 - 26:42)
Tom: Everybody saw that this was two months after the cancer. I went back in August or September. September, I guess.

(26:44 - 26:57)
Tom: Well, anyhow. 

Ruth: This is after we were married. 

Tom: Yeah, this is six, seven years after we're married.

(26:57 - 27:02)
Ruth: We were married nine years when you had the cancer. 

Tom: Nine years oh. I didn't remember that.

(27:04 - 27:18)
Tom: But prior to that, I told Ruthie, 'something's going to happen on June the 1st of my 42nd birthday.' And that was when I was on my way to Terre Haute. 

Ruth: On your 42nd year.

(27:18 - 27:50)
Tom: Yeah, my 42nd. 

Ruth: Your birthday wasn't June 1st. 

Tom: Yeah, I was 40. But anyhow, God's been with me. 

Alexis: Yeah. And then, what would you do around the house? I guess, what was your division of labor? What were your responsibilities? 

Tom: Oh, when I got laid off? Well, we had the hardwood underlayment. 

And I was, I guess, sweeping that. Whatever Ruthie told me to do. 

Ruth: You were building, finished building the house.

(27:50 - 28:18)
Tom: Yeah. Well, I worked on the ceramic, I guess. Uh, ceramic. 

We had the carpeting. The cupboards, we moved in there. We had a commode in one bathroom, a sink in another, and the bathtub in another. 

Ruthie had a problem with that. Eventually, we had custom-made cabinets for the house. This is when I'm working at U.S. Steel.

(28:19 - 28:33)
Tom: And making five bucks an hour or more. And, anyhow, the guy that came in and measured, he says, wow, you did a good job. You're within a 32nd of an inch for all the dimensions for the cabinets.

(28:36 - 28:52)
Tom: Cabinets cost us, I think, $900-some dollars. And they were, he charged, I think, $40 a foot for the bottom ones and $20 a foot for the top ones. How many there were, I'm not sure anymore.

(28:52 - 30:15)
Tom: I drew the house plans. The house plans I got when I lived at home before I met Ruthie. And from the Pittsburgh Press, I think they charged $7. 

And I modified them. I made it opposite hand. And instead of a carport, I made a 25 by 28 garage. 

Instead of a crawlspace, I had a 25 by 50 foot basement with a front 6 by 27 foot 4 fruit cellar under the front porch. 

Alexis: So you bought the house layout before you met Glammy or before you married Glammy? 

Tom: Before we married. 

Alexis: Before you were married. So after you met her. And then, how was it for you, because we kind of talked with Glammy, how was it for you when you were having to commute and be away from home? Like, not just, I guess, play-by-play, but like, the decision-making behind it and your thoughts about it. 

Tom: Whenever I'd come home, I think I would, well, she knew when I was leaving. 

When I got home, she said I was driving 10 1⁄2 to 11 1⁄2 hours from Terre Haute to Johnstone. That's 507 miles. I'd do that after working eight hours.

(30:20 - 31:03)
Ruth: Sometimes I didn't know how you got home. You were so tired. 

Tom: But that was every third week. 

One week, I would stay in a rooming house. Well, the rooming house, it was God was with me again. Ruthie found a place for me to stay through the three days, and that was Seelyville, I think. 

It was about 8, 10 miles, I guess, from J.I. Case's plant. Saturday morning, I'd get the newspaper and looking for places for rent, and I went for this one place, and I couldn't find it. So I crossed the street where this place was.

(31:03 - 31:46)
Tom: I knocked on the door, and I said, I'm a job shopper for J.I. Case, and I'm looking for this address. The lady says, 'we have rooms, but we don't advertise.' So anyhow, she says it's $50 a week or $165 a month, and it was cheaper to go with $165 a month. 

So I took it by the month. The two other job shoppers, they paid week by week, and I couldn't understand that. Because I was, constantly, the numbers flowing through my mind.

Ruth: They weren't at the same place you were.

(31:50 - 33:47)
Alexis: What was it like for you emotionally? 

Tom: Well, one week I'd come back, one week I'd stay there. I think Ruthie washed my clothes when I came back. Anyhow, there was a Dairy Queen, and one of the chef's, he didn't have any children of his own, but they had four adopted children. 

I used to go down to McDonald's and buy a box of sundaes, and I'd run them over to his house. I'd say, feed the kids, and throw the rest in the freezer. I did that I don't know how many times. 

I was generous helping other people. One guy was building a house, and I offered to help him, and never got a call from him. Near the end, Denny Goose bought a house that was used as a funeral parlor. 

Gigantic rooms in there, and anyhow, he was putting up black walnut cabinets in the front, in the back porch, and he was enclosing it. And I said, what do you want done? And he took me through the house, just astronomical stuff in there. I'd just love to own something like that someday, but I don't want to clean it. 

But anyhow, he had a whole bunch of pieces of stuff from the back porch, and he had it enclosed, and I was taking the pieces, cutting whatever, and I enclosed the outside and around the windows. I said, boy, he did a good job. Shortly after that, I got the job at Allison's, and that was $15 an hour, no per diem.

(33:49 - 34:05)
Ruth: You didn't get the job at Allison's until after the family was out there.

Tom: Yeah. 

Ruth: You're kind of jumping... 

Tom: Oh, yeah, I'm jumping a little bit right there. Oh, with Denny Goose, that was one of those three Saturdays.

(34:08 - 34:23)
Tom: I had no idea where the mall was down there. That was on the south side someplace. Never really traveled, but I didn't run very much to save gasoline.

(34:27 - 36:56)
Alexis: But how did the job loss, then having to be away from home, how did it make you feel? 

Tom: It was always stressed. I think it caused my diabetes, in my opinion. Oh, and that third week that I didn't go back, over my three weeks, the third week I'd go up to Chicago to Mrs. Sievers, the boarding house. 

Oh, Mrs. Severs after... 

Alexis: Way back. 

Tom: Yeah, I'm going way back now, after I started working. 

Alexis: To college. 

Ruth: You're not really answering her question. 

Alexis: Like being away from the family. What was that... Not just like the work, but what was that experience like for you? Your thoughts about it? 

Tom: It was hard, and I tried to distract myself with whatever. 

Go help people, do whatever. But at Mrs. Sievers, probably within three months of when I first got there, Charlie was scrubbing the floors, and she was giving him... 

Ruth: Well, you're going way back. He started to say about going on your fifth week, going to Mrs. Sievers. 

Now you're going way back. 

Tom: Way back. Okay, yeah, I slipped up there. 

Anyhow, one of the boys said, 'Tom's coming this weekend,' and Mrs. Sievers says, 'how do you know?' He says, we're out of watermelons and cantaloupes. I used to buy watermelons 50 cents, and I think the cantaloupes were a quarter. I'd load up the 77 Dodge Royal Monaco that we bought from Ruthie's friend's aunt or somebody. 

Alexis: I thought Mrs. Sievers was before you guys met. 

Tom: No, no, after. 

Alexis: After? 

Ruth: No.

Tom: Oh yeah, she was before. 

Ruth: He lived with Mrs. Sievers before he was married, but the contact remained. She came from Chicago to Pennsylvania for our wedding. It was not just a boarding thing. 

The relationship over the years changed. 

Tom: Yeah. 

Ruth: He was in Terre Haute some of those weekends when he was by himself. 

He would go up to Chicago and spend time. 

Alexis: Okay. I was like, we're back to college? No, so you were visiting Mrs. Sievers when you lived in Terre Haute by yourself? 

Tom: Yeah. 

Alexis: And you'd bring the... 

Tom: Harold was up there, so I got a chance to see him too. Anyhow, we'd cut hair. We'd do whatever.

(36:57 - 37:26)
Ruth: You're on the way back before we were married with you and Harold.

Tom: Yeah, so I was going to get back to this where when I walked in and Charlie wasn't doing the floors, scrubbing the floors the way Mrs. Sievers wants. She says, 'I don't know this guy coming in, but he can do a better job than you.'

Boy, I don't know how she knew that. So she says, 'you pay for two weeks and you get the third week free.' And after Harold got out there, neither one of us paid because we were working.

(37:27 - 37:33)
Tom: Working for her. We went over to Railroad Salvage. We picked up stuff.

(37:36 - 38:12)
Tom: When I worked for Ingersoll on the south side, there was a steam table that they were putting in machines and getting rid of the people servicing stuff. So there was a $1,200 steam table and I told Mrs. Sievers about it. And Gunther got a trailer behind the Cadillac, went down and got it. 

I come home from IIT that night. Harold's tearing out the cork refrigerator and they're tearing out a wall to put this steam table in. They put a... 

Alexis: Was Gunther Mrs. Sievers' husband? 

Tom: No, that was her son.

(38:12 - 38:49)
Tom: She had three sons, one daughter, and... I lost his name. Warner was her husband. He was captured. 

They came over from Hamburg in 1952. And I think three of the boys either drafted or had to go into the military. The one boy was... 

Alexis: For the U.S. or for Germany? 

Tom: For the United States. 

When they got to Chicago. She first went to... British Columbia and then back to Chicago with everybody. She scrubbed floors and did whatever.

(38:50 - 39:30)
Tom: How she found out about this house, I don't know. But the boys that were in the military, the one... The oldest one was a Mensis [Mensa]. That's an IQ of 170. 

He's an airman and anyhow he's flying from Newfoundland over to someplace over in England. And the guys were sicker than dogs. They got the plane off the ground. 

It was a C-130. Four engine jobs, which I eventually worked on those engines. And anyhow, they took the jump seats or whatever and he got instructions on how to fly.

(39:30 - 39:39)
He flew the whole way across the North Atlantic. When he got close to Ireland, I think he said, the guys are feeling better. He says, you guys better come up here. I don't know how to land this. 

(39:39 - 41:36)
Tom: But there was... These kids were really, really something. When I was making it... 

Ruth: What kids? Gunther, Hardy, and Klaus.

Klaus was the oldest. Gunther was second. Gunther, he had some kind of sickness. 

He was the weak child in the family. And Hardy was literally a football player. He was a bruiser. They worked at Donnelly's and Son.

They were making over six bucks an hour when I was making a buck thirty-five an hour. They were maintenance guys. Gunther, was he fixed it right. 

It took him a long time to fix it, but he fixed it right. It ran for years. And Hardy, Hardy was bog wire, any kind of tack wire, masking tape, anything he could use to fix something so that they could get the line moving and make money. 

But neither guy was fired. Eventually, Gunther took over Mrs. Sievers' house. 

Alexis: And they came to the United States in 1952? 

Tom: 1952. Mr. Sievers couldn't work. The Russians pulled all his teeth and he was tortured. He was a sergeant in the German Army. 

And everybody... Mrs. Sievers told me how things were during the war because I went through ROTC and I'm getting firsthand information on how things were. She says, first they came for the Jews, then they came for the...I'm trying to think of the German knowledge on them. They moved around and... 

Alexis: Oh, Roma.

(41:40 - 42:28)
Alexis: Travelers. 

Tom: Yeah, they were...started with an E, I think. I lost it, anyhow. 

Then she said, then they came for the Catholics and then they're coming for the Protestants, but they didn't get that far. They were...so they obviously left Germany after the war and Mr. Sievers had fought for the German Army. Did they ever... 

Tom: He had to. He was forced. 

Alexis: Did they ever receive negative attention for that? Did they ever... 

Tom: In Germany? In the United States? Yeah. No, I don't think so. 

But nothing that she said, that...nothing was held against them. Because the war was over for what, seven years or so? Yeah. The Korean War was going on and none of the boys had to go to Korea.

(42:29 - 42:45)
Alexis: And were the boys born in the United States or were they born in Germany? They were born in Germany. Hardy, test, when...like kindergarten, anyhow they had to collect parts. He had it together in four minutes and other kids took eight hours to put them together.

(42:45 - 42:51)
Alexis: Eight hours in kindergarten?

Tom: Whatever. I mean, they were simple parts, but he had it together.

(42:52 - 42:56)
Tom: Yeah. Well, he was good mechanically. I guess Gunther was too.

(42:57 - 43:12)
Tom: Klaus, I don't know what Klaus did. Mrs. Sievers showed me, she had a fur coat that came with the property, a $7,000 fur coat. Said, 'what do you think it is?' I said 'it's a fur coat.'

(43:13 - 43:32)
Tom: To me, it was nothing. But they had, with the property, they got a 42-foot sailboat and a cottage on Private Lake, Brown Lake, northern Illinois. So one time, Whitey, one of the wards of the city that Mrs. Sievers took care of, where we cut their hair.

(43:33 - 44:05)
Tom: And he comes over, he says, 'we're going up to the cottage.' 'What cottage?' We don't know anything. [unintelligible]

Nothing about it. They knew about it. So we hopped into Cadillac and we took them up there.

Blackberry briars were about 10 feet high. We had to cut our way into the cottage. That's how bad it was.

Harold hooked up the hot water tank. And I don't know what I was doing. We had enough food.

We took enough food for whatever. Got to Mass. Found out where the church was.

(44:05 - 44:14)
Tom: Went to Mass Sunday morning. 

Alexis: So Mrs. Sievers ended up going to your wedding one day. So would you say that you ended up becoming like friends? 

Tom: Oh, we were always friends.

(44:15 - 44:23)
Tom: Harold and I were treated like adopted nephews. 

Ruth: We actually went out to California. To visit her when she moved, after she moved.

(44:23 - 44:57)
Ruth: [unintelligible] Yeah. I used to call her Mrs. Sievers.

And she told me that one time she didn't like that. And I didn't know just what to call her. So I said, well, she was German.

Ruth: And Grandma in German is Oma. So I said, Oma. And then she was OK with that.

Ruth: I could call her Oma. 

Tom: When and Ruthie and I came back from the wedding. She took her bedroom. She gave it to us. And it's not a guest bedroom. I mean, it was a bedroom.

(44:58 - 45:22)
Alexis: So was she the one? Well, obviously, the boys worked. But was she like, for a while, because they would have been the one, was she like the sole economic provider for her family with Mr. Sievers being unable to work? 

Tom: Well, I don't know what happened. If the boys were helping or not.

But there was supposedly a $500,000 mortgage on it. 

Alexis: On the house? 

Tom: Three houses. Three houses.

(45:22 - 45:36)
Tom: Three stories high. 

Alexis: $500,000 in what years dollars? 

Tom: From what I understand, that was, say, like '64 maybe. Whenever she bought it, which I don't know when it was.

(45:37 - 46:01)
Tom: But she had DePaul University basketball players in there. She had the guy that got me the job up at Vance Transformer Company. Guys were working every place.

I mean, it was $25 a week. You couldn't go wrong on room and board. And I think she washed her clothes, too.

But don't quote me on that. She washed our clothes. Harold and mine.

(46:04 - 46:39)
Alexis: And after, you mentioned kind of in Glammy's interview, after you retired and you had more time to yourself at home, you struggled a bit. Can you talk about that? 

Tom: I just felt down that I had to do something. And basically, I used the same thing as when I was in Terre Haute, a long time away from Ruthie.

Distract yourself with doing something. So I was doing something around here. 

Alexis: Did you turn that into, like, doing housework? 

Tom: Did I do housework? I don't know.

(46:40 - 47::02)
Ruth: You told me when you retired, you were going to do it all. That didn't quite pan out the way I expected. Although, he does now.

Tom: I run the sweeper. I dust. I nuke the food.

I clean the bathrooms. Army training cleaning the bathroom. I don't do it too often, though.

(47:05 - 47:52)
Alexis: Is there anything else you'd want to share about how you feel like? 

Ruth: How you felt during those layoffs. 

Tom: It was stressful. Well, I was diabetic at 49.

And I always thought it was just in the family. But I was the first one with cancer. The first one was diabetes.

And a lot of things didn't make sense. After you have them a while, it starts making sense. And you hear other things.

I did discover, too, that you've got to talk to people and find out what they know. Because you have one mouth to talk, two ears to listen. And listen as much as you can and learn.

(47:53 - 48:05)
Ruth: And how did you feel when you were laid off with the family? You keep getting asked that. 

Tom: I guess I was. 

Ruth: You keep going off on a different tangent.

(48:05 - 48:47)
Tom: I guess to some degree, it was a little bit of a panicsville. Although, when you got laid off from the U.S. Steel in the Union, you got sub. Which was, subbing unemployment was 65% of your wages.

But by the time they took taxes, it wasn't much difference. But the last time, when there was no sub, it was bad. I was down to one half on an employment check.

And that's when I said a novena to St. Joseph. And that's when I got the job down at the Energy Utilization System in Plum. And I went from $10 an hour, where I worked at U.S. Steel, to $13 an hour.

(48:51 - 49:32)
Ruth: And I could have, I guess, like, bopped him one. We were on unemployment, and then the sub was going to start. And I'm looking forward to having extra money to take care of things.

Tom: Yeah I screwed that up.

Ruth: And he tells me, he tells me the church was having some sort of a drive to do, not for money, to do something in the church. And he told me, he committed to the priest that sub. And I, 'every last penny?' 'Yes, down to the penny.'

He committed to give that to the priest. 

Tom: I can't remember how long of a time. Was it a month or what? 

Ruth: Well, he got [unintelligible]

(49:35 - 50:03)
Alexis: Is that why you weren't in front in charge of the finances?

Tom: I didn't give it a thought, but no. No, I used to be real tight, penny, close to the wall when I threw it. I was a bargain hunter.

Tom: I was always a bargain hunter. 

Alexis: You're still a bargain hunter. 

Tom: In the Army. One time, we're out in the field, and everybody's all over the world. They're serving green bananas. Well, they're serving bananas.

(50:04 - 50:35)
Tom: So these are so green, and Cookie's throwing them out. He's got one of those chicken crates, you know, they're wire over the... 'You throwing those out?' 'Yeah.' 'Can I have them?' Cookie always knew.

Tom's coming. 'Can I have them?' And one time we went out. Usually, alerts were from four o'clock in the morning until ten.

But this was five days. Guys didn't have their soda. They didn't have anything.

All those candy bars from 1942, they ate. The soda crackers, they ate. The jelly, they ate.

(50:36 - 50:48)
Alexis: Oh, no. 

Ruth: And now you're back to the military. What about your layoffs with the family? You keep getting off that-

Alexis: I actually have a different question.

(50:49 - 50:58)
Tom: I guess I don't know how to answer that one. 

Alexis: I guess I want to frame this to you, because Glammy said that you didn't want her to work once you were married. 

Tom: Yeah.

(50:58 - 51:20)
Alexis: Do you mind explaining why? 

Tom: Well, I figured I was making enough money, and I was going to retire at age 53 from U.S. Steel, collect my pension, and do whatever we want to do. But I didn't want her to work. Because making five bucks an hour, that was good money.

(51:22 - 52:35)
Alexis: So you just?

Tom: I just figured I'd climb the ladder, but I didn't get above a detailed draftsman where I went in as. Well, there were three steps. Six months, you got a raise.

Another six months, you were firmly with the company, and you went up the ladders. The older people retired you. So I figured I'd either make a layout man or checker or designer someplace.

But they closed down in 81. And we got two years of sub added onto that. Two years credit for my employment.

So instead of 15 years, I got 17 years of credit, which gave us that $287, 77 cents pension. But Ruthie's done a good job with the finances.

Alexis: Anything else you want to share? 

Tom: Oh, when I worked at U.S. Steel, there's any craftsman tool I wanted to buy, I bought. A lot of stuff I used for the house. 

Alexis: Was there a discount? 

Tom: No.

(52:36 - 53:01)
Alexis: You just had enough money? 

Tom: Just had enough money. We bought a 220-volt air compressor. It was a small tank.

But I could use that, use impact wrenches on it. Bought a welder. We welded the frame for the... Well, no, I bought the welder... I'm trying to think.

(53:02 - 54:06)
Tom: I took a class before I was married, staying at home at... Trying to think of the name of the little community. [unintelligible], and there was a school up on top of the hill, and I think maybe we paid 10 bucks or something for a welding class. It was an electric welding class.

And he said, anybody that graduates from this class can go get a job for Johnstown Traction Company, which was hard to get into. But he said, 'you're good when you got done.' I made a tongue for Dad's trailers that he put behind the tractor.

And other... I welded the columns for in the house. I think I tack-welded the beams, because we had an 80-wide flange at 18 pounds come over, then a one-foot section, and then it ran over underneath the kitchen, living room, dining area. I think I tack-welded those, because I didn't want those to move.

(54:08 - 54:44)
Tom: I did make some mistakes on the house. With four-inch cast-iron pipes, it used to be a dollar and a quarter for four feet of cast-iron pipe. And brought them into the center, and then I ran a four-inch pipe out.

And I should have run an eight-inch pipe out. That's why the foundation... The cellar got flooded in the 77. I screwed that up.

So, my dad broke that up and hauled that out with Karen and Chris. And I had the cancer at that time, and I couldn't even help pour the floor in it.

(54:45 - 55:17)
Tom: I couldn't do anything there. 

Alexis: How did you... I guess you have cancer, and you get... Your body gets weaker. How did you work your way back to working again?

Tom: Well, we had to go... Was it five days a week? 

Ruth: For the first two weeks, I think you worked half a day.

Tom: No, I mean for the radiation. Twenty-three rads. 

Ruth: Five days a week.

Alexis: Five days a week for radiation?

(55:18 - 55:37)
Tom: And then going back to work. And then going back to work. I didn't recognize it, but somebody said, 'You've got to go back to work. Something's wrong with you or something.' So I went in and I said, 'Can I come back for half a day?' Half a day. Five days a week.

(55:38 - 55:57)
Ruth: You needed to get back to work, mentally. 

Tom: There was a lot of drive, Ruthie drove. 

Ruth: You needed to get back to the person you were.

(55:57 - 57:09)
Tom: Workaholic. I was a workaholic.

Ruth: No, not... I can't think of the word I want to say. But it was probably me saying like, You needed to go back to work.

I could see emotionally, mentally, whatever, that you were not recovered, but you needed to go back to work to finish recovery. We got full pay when I was... And we were on six weeks vacation. They had seven and 13 weeks.

I was in a junior group for seven weeks. But because I only had three [unintelligible]... I only got six weeks. And on the fifth week is when I had the cancer operation.

So we lost one week of vacation. It was counted as vacation, not sick leave that time. 

Ruth: No, I just knew to help you recover, you needed to go back on the job.

Maybe you couldn't go full time, but I think the first two weeks you went half a day. You needed to start somewhere in your recovery to get back to normal. 

Alexis: Well, thank you for sharing your story.

(57:09 - 57:13)
Tom: You still copying all this? 

Alexis: I am, but I'm scared my battery is going to run out. 

Tom: Okay.
