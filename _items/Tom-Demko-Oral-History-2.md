## Interview Summary
This interview was Collected by Alexis Shoulta December 2, 2025. It is a continuation of Tom Demko Oral History 1 that was collected on October 5, 2025. 

Tom was a draftsman and he first learned drafting as a high school math credit course. He went to Indiana Teachers College in Pennsylvania. He had to sit out a semester because of his GPA, so he went to Chicago Technical College to take drafting courses. He completed the two year course in eight months.

In Chicago Tom boarded with a woman named Mrs. Sievers. It cost 25 dollars a week, but he also would work for her and sometimes didn't have to pay. She and her family were post-war immigrants from Germany. Her husband, Werner was captured and tortured during the war, and couldn't work. So, Mrs. Sievers was the breadwinner of the family and made money by cleaning houses and eventually housing boarders. Eventually, the property they owned included three houses, a lake cottage and a boat. The mortgage was valued at 500,000 in 1964. Her three sons were drafted by the U.S. Military. Mrs. Sievers and Tom were very close, and he says that she treated them as if they were family. Eventually, Tom and Ruth visited her on their honeymoon. 

While living in Chicago he got a job where he started at minimum wage, 1.35 an hour. He got five raises in nine weeks. Each raise was a nickle more an hour. He would get three days pay, and he was saving his money to go to the Illinois Institute of Technology. He switched jobs again and worked his wages up to 350 dollars a month, and took night classes at IIT. However, he was drafted into the army and was sent to Fort Knox in Kentucky for basic training. He did well on his tests for the army.

During basic training Tom applied for Officers Candidate School. Based on how many years of math he had in high school determined he would be in the artillary over the infantry. He was sent to the Brooklyn Navy Yard. There he worked in the bakery. He would bring the other men snacks and food from his job for them to eat. They travelled by ship from Brooklyn to Hamburg. From there they went to Frankfurt am Main to Hanau to a base he does not recall the name of. The had nuclear weapons. He was in an honest john rocket battalion. They guarded the Fulda Gap against the Soviet Union during the Cold War. He recalls being given c-rations leftover from World War II. He also shared his strategies for utilizing his leave time.

In the military he traveled to 20 countries during the 19 months he was in Europe. After his time in the military he returned to Pennsylvania and lived with his family.

At U.S. Steel, Tom was a detail draftsman and when he moved to Allstate he moved up to becoming a designer. He worked for them for a little over a year before there was a cutback. He took a 15% pay cut. His pay started at 13 dollars an hour, while the men working on the shop floor made five dollars an hour. This went on until he was eventually totally laid off.

At the employment office he was told to take a lower job than what he was qualified to do. He then worked two days a week for five dollars an hour. He was still able to collect unemployment because he worked so little. One time while he was unemployed he was told he had to sign a form at a company to show that he went for an interview. On these forms he was asked about how many people were in his household rather than his skills.

He travelled to Florida for 3 days to do 11 interviews. At one interview he was told to transfer his engineering credidation and he would for sure have a job, however Tom wasn't a profrassional engineer, so he missed out on the job.

After that he went to York, Pennsylvania for work. The job was supposed to pay eleven dollars an hour, however, the job only paid 8 dollars and ten cents. He stayed as a boarder during the week while working in York. He would drive straight back to Johnstown from work on Fridays for the weekend.

The next job he got through a connection with a friend. It was located in Terre Haute, Indiana and it paid thirteen dollars an hour and per diem. His family continued to live in Johnstown, and he commuted back and forth between there and Terre Hauted. He would go back to Johnstown for one weekend every three weeks. In Terre Haute he worked for J.I. Case he was laid off in October. The company found him another job at an alluminum company in his neighborhood. He worked there for two weeks before getting another job at Allison Engine Company in Indianapolis. There he made fifteen dollars an hour without per diem. That job was 75 miles one way from Terre Haute.

When Tom lived alone in Terre Haute lived on fifteen to twenty dollars a week. He would get fried chicken and fries at K-mart for dinners.To distract from being away from his family, he liked to keep himself as busy as possible to distract himself. He would help people with odd jobs, and handyman work. He also would travel to Chicago to visit with Mrs. Sievers during this time, as they remained friends. He says during these times he felt always stressed, and he attributes diabetes he developed as a result of this stress.

He commuted with his friend Amos to Indianapolis for work. They met working at J.I. Case. Amos is African American and he experienced prejudice within the industry. For example, Tom's coworkers would question that he would allow Amos to drive his car. Together they would sometimes pick up hitchhikers.

His wife, Ruth was in charge of the finances in their household. She kept his paycheck, and would  be responsible for cashing them. Ruth didn't work, and Tom didn't want her to work. He felt that he was making enough money. He says that he thought he would climb the ladder, and have his pension in his 50s. However, the closures disrupted this plan.

While Tom was unemployed he worked on constructing their house, and he recalls a lot of the specific details of the construction. He bought the plans for the house from the Pittsbugh Press for seven dollars, and modified the plans to suit the family's needs. Sometimes when he was unemployed in a workplace with a union, he would get subpay from the union. It would be about 65% of their original pay. During the interview Ruth spoke up to say that, one time when they were on unemployment, she was planning on the sub pay starting, and she was looking forward ton money being less tight. However, the church had a fundraiser and Tom donated the entirety of a sub payment. It upset Ruth deeply.

Tom had various health issues. He got cancer while he was in his 30s. He had to take some time off for radiation treatment and eventually surgery. However, eventually returned to working part time and eventually full-time. They got full pay when he was unable to work from the treatment. He was diagnosed as diabetic at 49.

After Tom retired he felt restless without work. So again, he distracted himself with always having a task to do to be busy. Ruth chimed in to add that Tom used to say that he would do all the housework when he retired, however, that didn't quite turn out how she expected. Today he does a lot of the housework for her though.

Tom currently lives in Greenwood, Indiana with his wife Ruth.
