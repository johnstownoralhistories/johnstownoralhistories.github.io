## Interview Summary
This interview was Collected by Alexis Shoulta December 2, 2025.

Tom's first job shop was from his boss at U.S. Steel. At U.S. Steel he was a detail draftsman and when he moved to Allstate he moved up to becoming a designer. He worked for them for a little over a year before there was a cutback. He took a 15% pay cut. His pay started at 13 dollars an hour, while the men working on the shop floor made five dollars an hour. This went on until he was eventually totally laid off.

At the employment office he was told to take a lower job than what he was qualified to do. He then worked two days a week for five dollars an hour. He was still able to collect unemployment because he worked so little. One time while he was unemployed he was told he had to sign a form at a company to show that he went for an interview. On these forms he was asked about how many people were in his household rather than his skills.

He travelled to Florida for 3 days to do 11 interviews. At one interview he was told to transfer his engineering credidation and he would for sure have a job, however Tom wasn't a profrassional engineer, so he missed out on the job.

After that he went to York, Pennsylvania for work. The job was supposed to pay eleven dollars an hour, however, the job only paid 8 dollars and ten cents. He stayed as a boarder during the week while working in York. He would drive straight back to Johnstown from work on Fridays for the weekend.
