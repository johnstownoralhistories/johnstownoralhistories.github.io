## Interview Summary

Alexis Shoulta interviewed Thomas Demko on October 5, 2025.

Thomas Demko was born April 10, 1942 in Johnstown Pennsylvania. He grew up outside of town in the mountains, and describes what his home was like growing up. Most of his family was from Johnstown, and his sister currently lives there. He moved to Chicago in 1961 and was drafted from there in 1964. He left the army in 1966.

Tom's father worked in the steel mills, and he also was laid off for significant ammounts of time. During Tom's career, his employment as a draftsman in the steel industry was across the Eastern United States, and he was laid off eleven times. He was a United Steelworkers union member.

He recalls that his wife Ruth was laid off from her job right before they were married. Once they were married, she stayed home with the kids and took care of the house. Whenever Tom was laid off, she managed all of the finances. He recalls during the layoffs he would put out resumes, and get back one for every eleven he completed. When Tom was able to get work, it was sometimes 50 miles to 165 miles away. For the jobs that were farther away, he would only come home on the weekends.

Tom remembers Johnstown becoming more rundown and less happy as a result of the decline of steel. The loss in income among unemployed people caused services provided by local government such as the police force and sanitation suffered as a result.

He currently lives with Ruth in Greenwood, Indiana.

Alexis Shoulta: Thank you for being willing to share your experiences with me today.

If you need to take a break at any time, let me know and I can pause the recording and interview. We'll go back over your consent form at the end of the interview to review and confirm your previous choices. This is Alexis Shoulta interviewing her grandfather, Thomas Demko, October 5th, 2025. 

Hello, Thomas. 

Thomas Demko: Hi, Lexie. 

Alexis: Where and when were you born? 

Tom: April 10th, 1942 at 162 Deshaun Road, Johnstown, Pennsylvania. 

Alexis: What town do you currently live in? 

Tom: Greenwood, Indiana.

Alexis: What is your connection to Johnstown, Pennsylvania? 

Tom: My parents lived there. My sister lives in the area and all my relatives on my dad's side was there. 

My mother lived in New Florence most of her life, and she was one of 10 children. My dad was one of three children. 

Alexis: Did you live there as well? 

Tom: Yeah, I lived in Johnstown until I went to Chicago 1961. 

I got drafted from Chicago in 1964, got out of the army in 1966. And my employment was sort of scattered over the eastern part of the United States. I was laid off 11 different times. Some places in Pennsylvania when you were unemployed they asked how many people you were supporting besides your family in your house. They never asked you how much you knew. 

Alexis: What was your connection to the steel industry?

Tom: I was a draftsman. I was there for 17 years credit and finally got laid off in January of 1981. That was the third time that I got laid off from the steel mills.

Being laid off from the steel mills was a good situation in as much as when I got laid off, Pennsylvania's unemployment was good enough plus sub from the steel mills I was able to get most of my house completed without a big expense.


Alexis: Is there anything else you'd like to tell me about your family history? 

Tom: I wasn't in want of anything when I was growing up. We had enough of food. It was a little hard living way out of town like that in as much as there was no running water and for the first few years of my life we used a wash tub to take a bath. 

There was a coal stove in the kitchen. The house was a small house with two bedrooms on the second floor so there were four bedrooms in the house with the cellar and a sun porch and a fruit cellar underneath it. My dad had a I guess a rough life starting out until somewhere in the late 30s, prior to the war second world war, and once he started working in steel mills he was I would say middle class.

(4:22 - 7:48)
Alexis: I guess I'm going to ask you this question twice since your father also worked in the steel mills. Like, so what was your family like when your father was employed and working in the steel industry and did he also experience the layoffs? 

Tom: One time he was laid off for three months that's when we put the bathroom in and I think it was 1953 and we also got a tv set that time that year. 

Alexis: So even though he was laid off he was still able? 

Tom: He was off for 63-65 days it was quite a long time. 

Alexis: Then, what was your, like, your family as in you and Glammy and my my parent, my mom like when you were working in the industry? 

Tom: I think we were financially pretty well off we didn't owe any money anyplace. 

We drove cars we always had an extra car in case one car broke down I guess that's about it about that. 

Alexis: During this time what were the assigned roles in your family or like the division of labor in your family? 

Tom: Ruthie's boss laid her off the Thursday before we got married and she took care of the kids, which is my wishes and she took care of the house um the house we had in four bedrooms and three beds and you had to go to one bathroom to use the commode and another bathroom to use the tub and another bathroom to use the sink, but we didn't have a mortgage. And whenever layoffs came Ruthie managed all the finances and we made it. 

Alexis: I was gonna say, so you and your father both experienced uh results- layoffs as a result of the of changes in the steel industry? 

Tom: Right.

Alexis: How did your family respond to the layoff? 

Tom: Uh put out a lot of resumes. You get one out of 11 returns and most of them were dingletters. I was in the employment office so so often looking for drafting jobs any place that uh the one lady behind the counter told another lady "You see the guy back in the corner? He's got the micro fish and he'll show you how to find you type of job that you're looking for." I was always helpful to other people. 

Alexis: Then what actions  did your family take to manage like the consequences of the layoffs like financially or? 

Tom: Uh we didn't borrow any money. Ruthie made it, did a Cadillac job. 

Alexis: During the period in which steel declined in Johnstown did your like assigned family roles change in any way? Division of labor change in any way? 

Tom: When I had to go 50 miles or 165 miles for another job I'd be home on weekends on a 165 mile job the one was 50 miles away I drove that daily. And it was less time with Ruthie and family.

(7:50 - 9:06)
Alexis: Did you witness any changes in Johnstown as a result of the decline and closure of the steel mills? 

Tom: The houses were more run down, uh people didn't seem to be quite as happy the the atmosphere was different. 

Alexis: And I guess how would you say the community responded to the decline and closure of the steel mills? 

Tom: Financially it helped, it hurt the city that they couldn't provide for everybody. It hurt the police department the sanitation because you know they had a city tax the county tax I think and you had to pay that once every year it was a flat fee. So they they lost tax money because people left? Yeah well as people were unemployed. But they if you were working you had to pay the fee to work. Not quite like union dues but I was also in the union.

(9:09 - 9:58)
Alexis: How would you describe your time in the union before the layoffs, like what did the union do? 

How did you participate?

Tom: Not too much. There was one time that uh the union was trying to save the company no company was trying to save money on their hospitalization so any worker whose wife was working someplace else they would use the wife's hospitalization before the husband's hospitalization. Most of the jobs were all jobs when there were men there were just a couple clerks that were women. 

Alexis: Do you recall um how the union responded when people were laid off? 

Tom: Everything went by the rules of the union.

(10:00 - 12:01)
Tom: Seniority wise nothing could be done different than what the rules said. 

Alexis: And what were like what were the rules? 

Tom: Uh they had to give you a certain period of time notice when the layoff was uh because of the uh 2,000 I guess 2,000 workers there at the time. But you knew that uh you're basically getting 65 percent of your gross wages with the sub and unemployment which was almost what you take away was when you worked. 

Alexis: And was the union based upon the company you worked for or was it based on industry specifically? 

Tom: It was a steel union. 

ALexis: Do you remember which union it was? 

Tom: Um no I don't remember the number. It was too long ago.

ALexis: Like do you recall if it was like United Steel Workers or-? 

Tom: Yeah it was United Steel Workers. 

ALexis: Okay. 

Tom: But the local way I can't give you a number but maybe you looked it up someplace. 

Alexis: Do you know of anybody with experiences that you think I should reach out to as well for this oral history project? 

Tom: Most of the fellows are dead I think. Deceased. The only one I can think of maybe Jim Landry or Walter Gerber. Ones I usually call once a year. 

Alexis: Okay, well thank you so much for talking with me today. 

Tom: You're welcome. Have a good day. 

Alexis: I mean I guess is there anything else you'd like to add? 

Tom: I don't know. 

Alexis: Okay 

Tom: Well that was a short one.
