## Interview Summary
Alexis Shoulta interviewed Thomas Demko on October 5, 2025.

Thomas Demko was born April 10, 1942 in Johnstown Pennsylvania. He grew up outside of town in the mountains, and describes what his home was like growing up. Most of his family was from Johnstown, and his sister currently lives there. He moved to Chicago in 1961 and was drafted from there in 1964. He left the army in 1966.

Tom's father worked in the steel mills, and he also was laid off for significant ammounts of time. During Tom's career, his employment as a draftsman in the steel industry was across the Eastern United States, and he was laid off eleven times. He was a United Steelworkers union member.

He recalls that his wife Ruth was laid off from her job right before they were married. Once they were married, she stayed home with the kids and took care of the house. Whenever Tom was laid off, she managed all of the finances. He recalls during the layoffs he would put out resumes, and get back one for every eleven he completed. When Tom was able to get work, it was sometimes 50 miles to 165 miles away. For the jobs that were farther away, he would only come home on the weekends.

Tom remembers Johnstown becoming more rundown and less happy as a result of the decline of steel. The loss in income among unemployed people caused services provided by local government such as the police force and sanitation suffered as a result.

He currently lives with Ruth in Greenwood, Indiana.
