## About This Item

This photograph was taken at Karen's Christening on May 4th, 1969. 

## From the Contributor

Karen was born on April twentieth, fifteen days after her due date of April fifth. Ruth's labor lasted two hours, and she remained in the hospital for a week after the birth because she had bladder issues. She got home on Saturday. The christening was Sunday the following week, and they had a gathering at their apartment afterwards. 

Ruth says she didn't want to have the christening that quickly. She wasn't ready, and she wanted to delay it. However, Tom was insistent on having the baptism as soon as possible. She thinks that she dressed up for the event, wearing a dress and heels.
