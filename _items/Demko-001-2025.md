## About This Item

This is a picture from Tom Demko and Ruth Demko née Connell's wedding on June 29th, 1968. They were married at St. Joseph's Church in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. 

## From the Contributor

Tom and Ruth recall that they were married on a beautiful sunny day. They each had four attendants. The luncheon was held at the house of Tom's sister, Betty. The days leading up to the wedding had many mishaps. Most memorably, Tom forgot to organize transportation for Ruth to get to the church. One of Ruth's sister's friends found Ruth's Brother-in-law's car keys and drove her to the church in the car.

Ruth bought her wedding dress for 110 dollars.
