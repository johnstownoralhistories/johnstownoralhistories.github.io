## Interview Summary
This interview was collected by Alexis Shoulta on October 5, 2025.

Ruth Demko née Connall was born June 1st, 1940 in Youngstown, Ohio. She moved to as a toddler Johnstown in 1942 and lived there until 1985 or 1986. Her mother was originally from Johnstown, Pennsylvania, and her father was from Wheeling, West Virgina. They lived in one house with her mother's family -both of her grandparents, her aunt and her great aunt- for about three years. Her younger sister was born shortly after they moved. 

Her husband worked in the steel industry from before the time they got married until he was laid off in the 1980s. When they first got married she says life was easy, and because they weren't extravagent, they had enough money. Her husband was the breadwinner and she was the homemaker. She stayed at home and cared for their three children. On the mountain with them, Tom's father, his uncle and the man that lived up the road all worked in steel. However, she said there was a difference between being laid off as an office worker or a laborer on the floor.

While her husband was laid off from the steel mills, he would work on building their house. He would also go weekly to sign up for unemployment. She recalls that he was around the house more, and was able to help her more in the care of her third child Dana, who had Spinal Muscular Atrophy. As a result of the illness, Dana's muscles were atrophying and she needed full-time assistance. She could not sit up by herself, or walk. While Tom wasn't working, he would get up in the morning to take care of Dana, giving Ruth the opportunity to sleep in that she didn't normally have. He also helped Ruth with Dana's mobility. During his longest layoff, he didn't work for 15 months.

Ruth recalls the layoffs as uncomfortable. They had to be careful with their spending on food, and had to watch their money to afford their bills. She managed the money in the family, so she made the decisions for where to cut. She mentions that food was an easy place to cut back. She describes that they wouldn't buy snacks such as potato chips and ice cream. She would buy chickens and find ways to spread it three ways across meals. She says that they also ate a lot of pasta. At one point the family received butter and a block of cheese from the government. For different periods of time the family's income was low enough to qualify for reduced price or free lunches at school.

On the topic of the steel industry, Ruth recalls that the mills closed and people left town.  However, she recalls one couple that received a job opportunity in Texas through family, but refused to leave. Her family decided to go where they could find a job. Tom moved seperately from the family to Terre Haute, Indiana for work for a year. He only returned on the weekends every three weeks. She recalls one of Tom's coworkers also ended up commuting, she doesn't recall that commuting was common. She says generally people either stayed together or moved together. She recalls one steelworker who was laid off from the company a few months before he would have qualified for retirement. She says his wife went out and started cleaning homes.

Ruth recalls that it was difficult for her to parent without the support of her husband. It was important to her to not substitute her son, Christopher, as the man of the house because he was a young boy. She wanted to preserve his childhood. However, there were some jobs she had to give him to do because she could physically not do them. For, example she had him haul bags 40 lb bags of salt for the water softner, and get it loaded. It was also difficult having to deal with the school by herself on behalf of their children. In one case she dealt with a teacher who treated her daughter Karen poorly because she fell out with his son. Another case she felt was challenging handling by herself was when her daughter wanted to date an older boy. She found the lack of having her husband to support her in these situations hard. When she was going to church by herself, one time a lady asked her if Tom's cancer had come back because he wasn't there. Once one of her children asked her if she was going to the leave with Tom to got to Terre Haute too.

The rest of the family followed a year later in 1985. Ruth arranged the move by herself. Her friends came to help her pack, but she felt she did not have support outside of her friends in making the move. Because her mother had moved for her father's job, it didn't feel foreign to Ruth that her family might have to do the same.

Shortly after the family was reunited in Terre Haute, Tom was laid off again. He got a job working in Indianapolis and he commuted daily. They rented their house in Terre Haute. They were offered a good price to buy it. However, they didn't. They only stayed in Terre Haute until their oldest child, Karen, graduated high school. She says Tom couldn't take the drive anymore because it was too exhausting. He would come home, eat dinner and then go to bed. However, she says that was much better than not seeing him for weeks at a time while they were living apart.

She currently lives with her husband Tom in Greenwood, Indiana.
