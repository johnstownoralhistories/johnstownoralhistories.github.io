## Interview Summary
Joyce Homan was born May 3rd, 1970, in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. She lived in Johnstown until she graduated high school and moved to Philadelphia for college. She has since returned and works as a librarian at the local library.

Both of Joyce's parents were born and raised in Johnstown. Her father was a second generation Ukrainian American, and her mother's family had been in Pennsylvania since the 1700s. Her father worked on the floor as a laborer for Bethlehem Steel and most of her male family members of both sides of her family worked in with the steel mills or the mines.

The steel mills were a big part of Joyce's family's life. Working on the floor there were three shifts her father could be working any given day. Although sometimes he could choose which shift to work, other times he didn't have much of an opportunity to say no. She thinks that this was based upon the mill production and what they needed. Joyce recalls that her family's house was built around her father's inconsistent work schedule. Sometimes he would need to sleep during the day, and the kids would need to be quiet. The job would impact his mood, and she also recalls he would track home dirt and occasionally have burns.

Their household was organized traditionally. Joyce grew up raised Protestant. She says that this had an influence, but it was also just the way things were. Her father would be out working, and her mother was home as a homemaker. Her mother had previously worked in a sewing shop in Cambria City before she was married but stopped after she married and had kids. Although their family had traditional gender roles, Joyce doesn't think her father was particularly opposed to her mother working, and he had two sisters who had jobs. However, her mother had a heart condition that required multiple surgeries, and Joyce doesn't think her mother would have been physically able to care for the kids and go to work.

Because of the inconsistency of her husband's schedule, Joyce's mother kept the house, cooked, and did most of the emotional labor. She says her father would try to make it fun for the kids at various points, but like lots of men during men during the period he wasn't there all of the time.

When asked about the layoffs in the steel mills in Johnstown, Joyce recalls that like most families of people working on the floor of the steel mills, they did not have a lot of money. They already lived on a thinner edge, and then the layoff left them scrambling. They couldn't afford to not have any form of income. They had to get government assistance such as receiving food like government cheese.

Joyce's father became depressed during the times he was laid off. She says his family's immigrant background made a strong impression on his work ethic, and losing working was a loss of part of his identity. He hated having to receive assistance. Joyce's father was old enough to live through the depression when he was younger. She thinks that he felt like he grew up in difficult finances and had a determination to work hard so his family would not have to worry about money that way again. But then they did.

She says these times were also hard on her mother because hse was trying to take care of the kids, herself and then also help her husband. And although the gender roles didn't change during the layoffs it was a different dynamic to see the family provider struggling.

Joyce’s father was laid off several times before he eventually retired. During the layoffs he would do day labor work or a couple of weeks work in construction. This would provide some income for the family. 

She recalls the layoffs as being difficult for the family. Because of the job insecurity her father was very frugal. Her mother would always be looking for bargains and using coupons. Being a teenager, Joyce would want certain clothes or shoes and would not be able to buy them. Instead, she wore clothes her mother made, or hand-me-downs. At school, the kids qualified for free lunches. She recalls this being obvious to other children, and embarrassing. There were also periods when the family didn't have healthcare.

Joyce also recalls there being tension between her father and her maternal grandfather. Her grandfather was a boss in the mill, and he had money. Whenever he came to see them, he would drive a new Cadillac, and although he helped in some ways, Joyce does not recall it being a lot. She also thinks that there was tension between them because her father viewed her grandfather who was a boss as part of the group responsible for the layoffs in the mills. Especially because he didn't financially struggle from it.

She says her family found respite in their Ukrainian family. She would go over to her Aunt Irene's house, and they would go on little bus trips, or her aunt would buy them things. There were a lot of good memories at her aunt's house, and she helped them a lot. Joyce thinks that if her family had been isolated it would have been very difficult. 

Joyce recalls the changes in Johnstown. She remembers it being busy downtown, and her mother taking the kids to (Glossers) [https://www.loc.gov/item/pa2326/] to go shopping or walk around the park.[^1] However, as the layoffs started and Joyce went to college to town declined very quickly. She recalls coming back from college and the change being noticeable.

She thinks this had a significant impact on kids in her generation because their parents told them not to stay in Johnstown. She says the sentiment from their parents was that they were going to go to college and get a job somewhere else. For her personally, she thinks that not going to college was not an option for her in her family. Her father wanted her to get a job with computers because he thought computer jobs would make money. But overall, she thinks what he was saying was that he did not want her to work a labor job. She thinks this sentiment was also happening in her extended family and her friends’ families where the parents wanted the kids to do something "better" for themselves.

Joyce recalls that her father participated in the union and that we could go out and talk with a coffee klatch of guys. She says they had a lot of anger at the mill, the bosses, and the union because they felt unsupported. They also would talk about how horrible the conditions were in the mills. She would go to the library during her father’s union meetings. Afterwards he would talk to her and complain about how the negotiations were going. The union was trying to play both ends, to save the workers' jobs but degrading their protections to do it. She says this would put them in unsafe positions.

In Johnstown, Joyce says the workers in the mills were not respected or valued. They made a living wage, but she feels that the work stole some of her father's life and by extension her family's. It makes her sad.

Joyce recalls driving by a sign next to the U.S. Steel mill in Moxham there was a board they would drive past when they went to church on Sundays. It would say home many days there had been without an accident. When she was a little kid, she would always check the board. For her it was connected to her father and her perception of his safety. She says that if you saw the number go down to zero or a few days you would know someone had been injured. She says people knew the conditions in the mills were bad. Sometimes her father would come home angry or silent, and her mother would tell her someone got hurt or killed on the job, and her father would witness it. She knows at least once someone fell in a vat of boiling metal and died. 

She says the people in their sphere all saw and knew how dangerous it was.

Once when she came home from college, Joyce recalls her father asking her to help him write a letter of protest because they were going to take his pension away. He was worried if he lost his pension and passed away Joyce's mother would not have any income to sustain her. He felt very strongly that she wouldn't be able to go out and get a job if something physically happened to him. So, losing his pension would have been a big deal.

After fifth grade Joyce's father built a house in Vinco, so she went to high school in the County seat, Ebensburg. For Cambria County Ebensburg was affluent. She says the mixture between the poorer working-class kids and the kids with money in Ebensburg was uneasy. She recalls the layoffs as being shameful. She didn't talk about them with the Ebensburg kids because it would be a quick way to get bullied. Joyce felt more comfortable with kids that came from similar backgrounds to her, they got it a little more. She would talk about what was happening with her father at home with her closest friends who had a similar background.

Joyce says being in the gifted program at school, and her teachers helped her to guide her in her college applications. She says she learned how to perform some class things from the richer kids around her at school. Joyce had imposter syndrome about moving to the city, and there was a lot to figure out. However, the people who she relates the most to and have been her closest friends come from similar backgrounds.

She worked several jobs throughout her life and became a librarian in her forties.

Joyce wants people to continue to tell their stories from Johnstown and to remember the people who gave a big part of their lives to the steel mills and the mines because their lives were built on their labor. 

Joyce currently lives in Mineral Point, Pennsylvania.

Alexis Shoulta: This computer. Okay, we're recording. Hello. 

Joyce Homan: Hello. 

Alexis: Thank you for being willing to share your experiences with me today. As I previously mentioned, the study aims to collect oral histories and recollections of deindustrialization in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. 

I'm studying the impact of changes in the work environment on families and people's life experiences. Our interview today should last approximately an hour. I'm going to ask you a series of questions about your family and experiences with steel in Johnstown. 

This interview is being recorded for oral history preservation and historical analysis purposes. If you need to take a break at any time, let me know and I can pause the recording and interview. We'll go back over your consent form at the end of the interview to review and confirm your previous choices.

(0:39 - 0:50)
Alexis: Okay, so can you tell me your name, please? 

Joyce: Sure. My name is Joyce Homan, H-O-M-A-N. 

Alexis: And then where and when were you born? 

Joyce: I was born May 3rd, 1970, in Johnstown, Pennsylvania.

(0:51 - 11:04)
Alexis: And where do you currently live? 

Joyce: I live in Mineral Point, Pennsylvania. 

Alexis: What is your connection to Johnstown, Pennsylvania? 

Joyce: I was born and raised here. I lived here until I graduated high school. 

And then I moved to Philadelphia and went to school and grad school. And then I came back. I'm a librarian at the local library. 

Alexis: And what is your connection to the steel industry? 

Joyce: My dad and some of my uncles and my grandfather worked in the steel mill, in the Bethlehem steel mill. 

Alexis: Would it be most of your family, like most of the male members of your family?
 
Joyce: Yeah, I would say so. Either the mill or the mines on both sides of my family. 

Most people work there. Yeah. 

Alexis: And so, I guess, can you tell me a bit more about your family history? 

Joyce: Sure. So, my mom and dad were both born and raised in Johnstown. My dad is second generation. My grandparents immigrated from what's now considered Poland-Ukrainian border. 

So, he my immigrant grandparents. And then my mom, she's from the Tanneryville area of Johnstown. They have lived there for quite some time. 

And her family goes back to about the 1700s in Pennsylvania. So those are my parents. My grandfather, her dad, worked in the mill. 

He worked as a boss in the mill. And then my dad was on the floor. He was a laborer working in the mill and in several different areas. 

And then uncles, cousins, lots of folks who worked there. And then also some folks who worked in the mines too. But that's more distant. 

I would say mostly we're a mill family. 

Alexis: Can you kind of tell me what it was like when your father was employed and working in the steel industry before any major layoffs? 

Joyce: Sure. It was always a big part of our lives. 

I think one thing I remember very clearly, even as a little kid, was that there were three shifts. So, there was the day shift. There was the three to eleven shift. 

And then there was something they called night turn, which was eleven to seven. And he could choose sometimes what shift to work. But then also, they asked him basically to do these different shifts, and he didn't really have an opportunity to say no. 

So, the house was always sort of built around when he was sleeping, when he was coming home. I'd be getting up in the morning, and he'd be coming back from work. And so, my mom would be busy making him breakfast. 

Or if he needed to do the three to eleven shift, sometimes he would be sleeping during the day. So, my memories, that's definitely one memory that we kind of always had to be quiet or sort of base it around his work schedule. And then, just, I mean, there was a lot of dirt you know, to be honest. 

I mean, he came home dirty. Sometimes he would have burns and it affected his mood too. It was not an easy job. 

So those are memories I have very profoundly as a kid of sort of who my dad was in relation to his job and kind of how it impacted our family. 

Alexis: And I guess during this time, what were the assigned roles in your family, like between your parents, like their responsibilities? 

Joyce: Yeah, that totally makes sense. Very traditional household. 

I also grew up in the church, in the Protestant church. So that was sort of an impact on the family, but then also just the way it was, my dad was out working all the time, and my mom was very much a homemaker. So that's, she had worked actually, before she married my dad, she worked at Best Farm, which was a sewing shop here in Johnstown in Cambria City. 

But then after she got married and had kids, she was a homemaker full time. 

Alexis: And I guess going back into your dad working different shifts, were the differences in shifts predictable or would it be kind of random whether he would be on first or second or the night? 

Joyce: It was pretty random. I mean, I felt that way as a kid and even as a teenager growing up that it would, I think it was really based on what the mill production was and what they needed. 

So, I mean, again, they would ask him, I think, but he very much felt like he had to say, yes, there wasn't really a choice. So it was, yeah, it was pretty random. 

Alexis: And so, did a lot of the stuff at home kind of fall on your mom then because of him not necessarily being able to know his schedule? 

Joyce: Oh yeah, for sure. I feel like my mom really was the connecting part of our house, like many women, I think in that era. I mean, she kept the house, she cooked for us, she was giving all the emotional labor, I would say, pretty much fell to her. We knew my dad and he tried to make it fun for us in different ways, you know, at various times, but he was not there all the time as a lot of guys weren't during that time, I think. 

Alexis: And was it the expectation for your mom that she wouldn't work once she was married in the community or was that a personal expectation for herself? 

Joyce: That's a good question. I don't think my dad was opposed particularly to her working in the sense of like my aunts had jobs, his one sister was a nurse, the other one, she worked at Sunny Hanna cleaning. So, like if my mom, oh, I guess I should say too, I didn't mention, my mom was physically, she had a heart condition, she had a hole in her heart. 

So, she had multiple surgeries when we were kids and yeah, there was just, so I don't think she could have done both. I don't think she could have had kids and worked as well, would have been too hard on her physically. So, but my dad, I guess what I'm saying is my dad, I don't think would have been opposed. 

He wasn't quite like, like he definitely was into traditional gender roles, but he wasn't like, oh, my wife isn't going to work. He wasn't like that. 

Alexis: And then was your family impacted by the layoffs and Johnstown? 

Joyce: Oh, yes. Yeah, for sure. You know, I would say most people who were working on the floor like that, you know, we didn't have a lot of money. And so, living sort of with that thinner edge of not having a lot of money, when you had a layoff like that, you know, you were scrambling, you could not afford to not have some sort of income. 

So, and I also remember, my dad was just very depressed during that time when he was laid off. I mean, he was very, I would say I grew up in a, how can I say without generalizing, like an immigrant household mindset of like, sort of like you were going to work very, very hard. And if you have that taken away, that was like a big part of your identity. 

So, I remember, I just remember him like laying on our living room floor and being very depressed. And, you know, we had to go and get some assistance, the government cheese that people joke about, like, that's a real thing. I remember that so clearly. 

And he hated that he really did. And so, it impacted our household dynamic again, because, you know, before he was absent, and we didn't really see him as much. But then when he was present, and he wasn't working, he was very depressed. 

So, I mean, that was a hard, you know, and my mom's trying to take care of us, take care of herself, help her husband. It was a lot. It was a lot. 

Alexis: I guess kind of how did the job insecurity like, what was the form it took? Was it like several layoffs, and then he would get work again? Or was there like one final layoff eventually? Do you mind elaborating on that? 

Joyce: Yeah, for sure. Um, he actually ended up retiring from the mill, but he did have several layoffs. And during that time, when he was laid off, he worked construction. 

So, um, you know, he would, like, sort of be depressed and not have work. And then he would go and talk to the construction guys, and they would give him sort of like day labor, or a couple weeks or things like that. So, he would have some income coming in. 

And that happened to my memory, at least two times, possibly three with the mill. And, yeah, it was, it was difficult. It was hard. 

Alexis: Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that. Um, how did your family, I guess, respond to like the layoffs, like in their decision making or economic choices? 

Joyce: I think my dad, because he had that insecurity, he was very of the job insecurity. He's very, um, frugal, I would say. 

So, I think you know, my personal memory of things as being a teenager, and, you know, you want to buy certain shoes or clothes or things like that. And he was definitely like, my mom would make some of our clothes or, you know, there would be hand-me-downs or things like that. And, you know, it was kind of embarrassing, you know, or we would have school lunch, you know, we would get free lunch. 

And that was very obvious. So, like to the other kids. So, I mean, that was embarrassing too, you know, and I mean, my mom was just scrimping every dot, coupons were such a thing. 

They, my mom, even, even in her older years, she would always be looking for bargains or coupons or things. And my dad was old enough that he also lived through the depression. So, I think he felt like, or the very tail end, I should say the very tail end. 

So, I think he felt like he grew up in difficult finances, his parents died when he was very young. So, like he had that mentality. And then he was like, ‘I'm going to work, I'm going to work so hard. And like, we're never going to have to worry about that kind of stuff again.’ And then he did. So, I think that impacted our family a lot, too.

(11:06 - 13:52)
Joyce: Can I say one more thing about that? So, my grandfather was a boss in the mill, my mother's father, and they had some money. And I felt like there was always when my grandfather would come over to see us, he drove in, he drove a new Cadillac, he would like, get it replaced every year. And he did help us in some ways, but I don't think financially a lot, you know what I mean? Just being honest. And so there was always that tension between him and my dad, I think of like, you know, my dad viewed him as like, you know, he was responsible in some ways for, you know, those mill layoffs, and that he didn't struggle or suffer in any way really from that. 

So, it was an interesting, well, with the eyes of an adult, I can say it was an interesting dynamic as a kid, it wasn't super fun, you know? 

Alexis: Yeah. Yeah. And my grandparents have expressed something similar as well. 

And I guess what you say, was there community support in other ways outside of your family? Or like outside in other members of your family, maybe? 

Joyce: Yeah, definitely. I would say, you know, Ukrainians, especially, I feel like my dad had a very large, like a lot of brothers and sisters, his at least one brother worked in the mill, I think two. So that was a respite for us, like we would go over to my aunt's house. 

Like I said, my grandparents died very young. So, my aunt kind of took care of my dad, my dad was the baby of the family. She definitely helped us like, so many of my good memories as a kid of going to their house of her taking us on little bus trips or things like that, buying us stuff. 

I mean, she was, I miss her every day, my aunt Irene, she was fantastic. But so, I think that helped us a lot, you know, if we had been very isolated, like, that would have been really, really difficult. But, you know, she, she's very no nonsense. 

She was very practical. But she was also just a great, you know, she loved us, and we knew it. So that was a big support all of his family, my mom's family a little bit less, so I would say they're, you know, very, they're white Anglo Saxon Protestants, and they don't, they're not super emotional. 

I love them. But, you know, it was just kind of a like, 'well, it's going to be okay.' And it wasn't super warm and fuzzy. 

So, I don't know, I identify more as being Ukrainian, because that was my upbringing, you know, I enjoyed that. 

Alexis: And then during this period, like a steel decline, and maybe job insecurity, did your family roles change in any way in response? 

I mean, or dynamics, maybe? 

Joyce: I mean, I think so. You know, my mom was, I mean, my mom was always a caretaker.

(13:52 - 18:24)
Joyce: First and foremost, that was definitely her role. But I think my dad was always a very strong person. And so, to see him sort of struggling, and I wouldn't say weak, because you know, he had totally understandable why he felt the ways he did. 

But you know, when you're used to seeing somebody in that role, and then all of a sudden, he can't always provide or like, you're really struggling. That was definitely a different dynamic and kind of scary, I think, for us as kids, you know, like, what is happening here, you know? 

Alexis: Yeah. And then did you witness any changes in Johnstown, like as a greater city as a result of the closure of the steel mills, or like the closing in different periods of the steel mills? 

Joyce: I am old enough to remember, you know, I often will talk to people at the library, and they'll say, ‘Oh, my gosh, I have all these fond memories of Johnstown.’

And I'm old enough to remember it like that. Like I can remember it being busy downtown, or our mom, our mom taking us to Glossers to go shopping, or just walking around the park, or just being so many people downtown. And then, you know, it really is the layoffs started. 

And then, you know when I went to college, that was really when it started. And I mean, it just declined very quickly. It was, you know, just-

Alexis: Was it was it like, maybe you went to college, you came back, and there was less people? Like, would you say that it was? Yeah, it was sudden, like, there was a lot like a lot of people left all at once, or it was kind of slower?

Joyce: I think it was happening, like attrition was happening. And we didn't quite realize but then it became more dramatic to me because I was away. And then I came back and I was like, whoa, like, you know, these stores are closing. 

Where are all the people? You know, I think it had a huge impact on my generation, because our parents were like, you're not going to stay here. Like you're going to go get a you're going to go to college, you're going to go get a job somewhere else. And that was that. 

I'll never forget my dad. He was a very intelligent man. He read the paper every day, really instilled in me a love for reading, but I remember him talking to me about college. 

That that was like, if I had not wanted to go, that was not an option. Like I was going to college, he was quite clear about that. But I remember him saying to me, and this was in the eighties. 

He was like, in the mid to late eighties. He was like, 'You need to get a job with computers, because that's what's going to give you the most money.' So he didn't really even know at that point, like, what that was going to look like just that a computer needed to be involved somehow. 

And I think what he was saying without necessarily saying it was, you're not going to work with your hands, you're not going to work in a labor job, because I've lived that and that's not what I'm, I want for you, you know. And I mean, so and again, that was not just me, that was my, you know, as you know, my friends, families and our family, other family people in our family talking to their kids that way of being like, go do something better, quote unquote, for yourself, you know, so. 

Alexis: And then I guess to go more to like the community level, did you feel like you saw a response in the community to the decline and the closure of the steel mills outside of like, people leaving, like, did people talk about it? Was there like a sentiment amongst the community that you recall? 

Joyce: I do. I mean, there are certain things that I remember very specifically. You know, my dad and I, I am a, I believe in, what am I trying to say in organizing and having a union, I do believe in those things. My dad definitely had mixed reactions to that, as did some of the guys he worked with. 

I mean, they felt like that I'm just speaking of him and the conversations he would have with his friends. He had like a coffee klatch of guys that would go out and talk. And sometimes I would ride along with him. 

So I was just like the little kid listening and, you know, I didn't really understand how part of it was like, I don't know, like mid-teens, you know, but I would hear them talking about it and it would be like, so, so much anger at the mill, at the bosses, at the union, because they felt like they weren't really supporting them. And multiple times he, his union meetings were across the street from the library. So I would, he'd drop me off at the library and I'd be reading and then he'd come pick me up and he would tell me things and he would be like complaining most of the time about how things were going and the negotiations and things like that.

(18:25 - 21:35)
Joyce: So, and, and then again, those coffee klatches he would have with the guys, if I was with them on a Saturday, hearing them talk to each other about just how hard it was there. Just terrible, I mean, it was a terrible, terrible conditions. They were not respected. 

They were not valued really in any way. I mean, they made money, a living wage, I guess, which, you know, is something, but, you know, it, it just, it, it really, I do feel this, it stole some of my dad's life and by extension, our family. And I, I feel very sad about that. 

And I'm, I'm saying that as a community person too, I think it did it for many families. So.

Alexis: I don't know if you recall, do you recall if some of the contention was, was the union making decisions that was degrading like, like worker protections to try to financially prop up the companies? Was that happening in Johnstown? 

Joyce: Absolutely. You know, again, I think they were playing both ends against the middle and they felt like they were trying to help the guys, but, you know, now I think like, I don't know, honestly, like OSHA or somebody would have gone in and be like, are you kidding me? Like with the conditions they had to be in. 

But I remember specific times when my dad would talk about somebody getting injured on the job. And also, so U.S. Steel was also in Johnstown in Moxham and there was a board that we would drive by when we went to church on Sunday. And it said how many days they had been without an accident. 

And as a little kid, I just would always check that board. It was somehow connected to my dad and feeling like, is he safe? And I don't know when you would see the number go down and that it was at a zero or a couple of days, you knew someone had been injured. And so I don't know if they were required at that time to post that or why they posted that, but in connection with that, I'm saying like, I feel like people knew that the conditions there were not well, and that was part of, you know, the union was trying to keep their jobs, but then they also had to make these concessions of unsafety for them to keep their jobs, you know, and that, you know, my dad would sometimes come home and he would be angry. 

He had been an alcoholic, but he, when he met my mom, he stopped drinking and he never drank again, but he still had things in connection with that. And he would come home and be angry. He never hurt my mom or hurt us, but like he would be angry or he would be very silent. 

And some of those times my mom would say, 'Well, somebody got hurt or got killed on the job today.' So, like he was witnessing that, you know what I mean? He was seeing, you know, people, I know there was somebody who like fell in a vat of boiling metal and died. And, you know, so like, I can't even imagine what that's like to go there every day and be like seeing that kind of stuff. 

And everybody saw it. They knew it. Well, I can't say everybody, but I mean, the people in our sphere knew that you know.

(21:36 - 22:15)
Alexis: Yeah. And it's like such a hard choice to like because that's your livelihood, right? And choosing to go back and knowing like, yeah, it's so hard to think about. Do you know, and this is kind of specific because my grandfather brought this up to me. 

I'd never heard it before, before he told me about it. He told me that when he was working at US Steel, sometimes like they had the men who had wives that had jobs, they would switch their health insurance to their wives. So, and then they would like, did your father ever like lose health coverage? Because I know like healthcare would have been important in your family with your mom.

Joyce: Yeah. And I know that that was always a struggle for him too. We had periods where we did not have healthcare.

(22:15 - 23:02)
Joyce: We were very fortunate that we did not, I don't know, like it didn't impact us the way it could have impacted our family. But what I definitely remember is my dad coming to me when I had been in college and he asked me to help him write a letter because they were going to take his pension away. And so, he, I still have it somewhere where he basically asked me to help him write this letter to protest and say, like, I gave you all these years and you're trying to take my pension away, like don't do that. 

And they did, I'm trying to remember, I don't want to be wrong about this. There was some aspect of that where they like, it was lesser healthcare that they gave them. This is towards the end when they were getting ready to close, but they were able to keep some of it.

(23:03 - 23:21)
Alexis: I mean, do you mind elaborating a bit about like the loss of pensions? 

Joyce: Oh sure. 

Alexis: My grandfather didn't tell me about that. 

Joyce: Just, just, and I mean, this is Bethlehem, you know, I can't speak for US if they went through similar thing. 

Yeah. He, and he didn't work at Bethlehem he; he worked at US Steel. Yeah.

(23:21 - 31:37)
Joyce: Did he work in Moxham? I, I am not sure.

Alexis: I actually don't know which one. 

Joyce: I mean, I, as far as I know, that was the big one. 

Like they still have a facility there that does something. It's not called US Steel anymore. 

Alexis: I know he worked with wire at one point. 

Joyce: Did he? Okay. That's interesting. I would be curious. 

I'll have to watch his interview, but. 

Alexis: He was a draftsman. So, he was in the office. 

So, he wasn't as like on the floor. He wasn't experiencing things the same way. But I know that he, he bounced around between different places for a while and he, but mostly tried to stay at US Steel. 

Joyce: Very interesting. Yeah. For us, I mean, you know, my mom didn't have an income. 

So, if my dad had lost his pension, I think it would have been up to him. I mean, he would have had social security, but like that would have not really been very much at all. So, I think it would have been really hard, especially for my mom, you know, and when he passed, I mean, that was basically, she did have a widow's benefit from that. 

And that really, I mean, obviously we helped support her too, but like, that's what sustained her, you know? So, I think he felt very strongly that she wasn't going to be able to go out and get a job if something happened to him, you know, physically. So yeah, it was, it was a big deal. 

Alexis: And then I don't want to like switch gears too much, but I'm interested in like at the, like among people your age, like what were the perceptions? Like, I guess I'd say among people, your own age with what was going on, did you like ever talk about it with your friends or was it like kind of everybody was aware, but people didn't talk about it?

Joyce: Well, so I, what I will say about that is that I went to a high school, you know, we grew up in Johnstown. I was, went to school in Johnstown until I was in fifth grade. And then I came out here, my dad built a house out in Vinco. And so, we went to high school in Ebensburg and Ebensburg is the county seat. 

It is pretty, it's pretty money. It's still pretty money. I would say for Cambria County, you know, not for the world at large, but so when I went to middle school, the middle schools were a funnel of like rural Jackson township kids and then people from Ebensburg, the city kids. 

And there was, I don't know if your mom talked about it, this at all, or she had that perception, but it was definitely an uneasy mixture. And so the kids who were in Ebensburg, who I, I would say I wasn't super close with the kids from Ebensburg, but there were people from coal patch towns around like Collier, Nanty Glo, different places that went to the middle school up there. Those are the kids that I felt comfortable around. 

It was, it was shameful. I was ashamed of it. I felt like, you know, we were, did not have money, did not talk, you did not talk about it with the kids from Ebensburg because that was a surefire way to get bullied or teased. 

So, you know, the people that I connected with, they just got it a little more, you know what I mean? And I honestly have carried that with me my whole life. When I talk to somebody who grew up working class, there's just a connection there, even though I have a graduate degree and I'm a professional, you know, a librarian, I still, I'm like, that's my roots. That's where I came from, you know? So, so I wouldn't say, that's a long-winded way of saying I didn't really talk about it too much other than with my closest friends who kind of had that similar background. 

Alexis: And then I guess I would say, so was Ebensburg not really a heavily, like, was it not a super industry town? I guess, where was the money coming from was kind of like, what kind of jobs were people working there? 

Joyce: You know, that's a really good question. I, I guess banking, there was a banking industry, a lot of white-collar types of jobs. Some of the people, I guess, were working at the mills. 

It's only about like a half hour, 40-minute drive. Yeah. I'm trying to think doctors, lawyers, people that I, you know, I was in the gifted program, and your mom was as well. 

And so, we were with a lot of people whose parents had those kinds of jobs, you know what I mean? And so, yeah, that's, that's kind of where they were coming from. But again, towns right outside of there, like Colver, a good example, had a mine. And so, a lot of the kids from there, their parents, you know, their dads were working in the mines like that. 

Alexis: And then I guess when I, when you think about like going to college, there's sometimes like a kind of, the word they use for like grad school, like hidden curriculum, but I don't know if I feel like that's right for undergrad, but like, there's definitely like things you need to know to do to like apply, an SAT. There's kind of stuff that's like, I'd say can be very class-based understanding of like application. So, I guess what was applying to college like for you as an experience? 

Joyce: I am fortunate that I was in the gifted program. My parents wanted to support me, but they literally had no idea. And I mean, again, my parents are past. I love them. 

I respect them so much, but there was definite, there were so many class things that I did not understand. And so, I was fortunate that like the college that chose me, I got a scholarship and, you know, I had great teachers like the librarian at my high school, my English teacher, we had a guidance counselor. I felt like he helped a little less, but kind of guided me in those ways. 

And I was also determined that I was going to know. And I soaked up a lot from being around those kids. Like I learned a lot and watch them about, oh, this is how you do it. 

But again, there's some level of like, I don't know, imposter syndrome back then, or something of like, am I going to be able to handle this? You know, am I going to be able to go to a big city and do this? But I did it. And I think a lot of young people do. And I'm always determined to like, help the kids at our library or different things like that, because a lot of them don't know either, because their parents don't know, you know? 

Alexis: Yeah. And then I guess in college, would you say that your background was different from a lot of the people that were there? Or would you say that you found other kids that had kind of made their way from working class backgrounds? 

Joyce: Yeah, I would say some, most of my closest friends, again, at college were ones who, and I went to a religious school. So, we had that in common too. So, there was sort of that common language. 

But yeah, I would say the kids that I got the closest to and still have some relationships with, mostly had a working-class family background, as I'm thinking about. Well, my one best friend who I'm still friends with, her dad, was a teacher and a principal. So that was a little different. 

But she was very down to earth. She was from New York. And just, I don't know, there was just acceptance and kind of a lack of pretension there, you know? And so, I felt embraced by that. 

I appreciate that. But it was definitely, oh my God, there was so much to figure out. Like, I had no idea what I was doing. 

So, and I was, I also graduated young. So, I was 17 when I went to college. And yeah. 

And then certainly in graduate school, which is a whole 'nother animal, you know, I don't know, we could talk about the academy all day long, but you know, that's, I value education so much. I don't particularly value that classist, those classist things that kind of come in from time to time, you know. 

Alexis: And then I guess, how did you, I know you talked about your father really encouraging you to work with computers and to find a career outside of more like industry. 

I guess, how did you make your way into finding your own career in college or before college? I guess whenever you decided or learned. 

Joyce: Yeah, I have to, I have to think about that for a second. Cause I mean, I was a social work major when I first started. 

I was an undergrad social work major. And I probably like in my junior year, I was like, this is just, I don't know what I'm doing. So, I quit going to college and I moved to Philadelphia, like my college was in the suburbs of Philadelphia.

(31:37 - 33:12)
Joyce: So, I quit, I moved to Philadelphia. I took a job as a receptionist at a bank trade association. And that I feel like was when my education really started because I was living in a big city. 

I was having all these experiences working for people that, yeah, I don't know. It was just kind of crazy. So, it was a very circuitous route. 

There were many other steps along that path, and I ended up being a recruiter for a while. And then I came back to librarianship when I was in my forties. I shouldn't say come back. 

That was never other than being a little kid and thinking about it. Like in my forties, I think that was when I went to grad school and said, I'm going to be a librarian, but I've always loved books. I mean, obviously there's so many other components of being a librarian, but that was like the sort of kickoff point, I guess, just loving books, learning, reading. 

So, I'm grateful that I got that instilled in me. 

Alexis: Yeah. And then I guess, is there anything I haven't touched on that you think is important that I haven't asked you about? 

Joyce: I just, I appreciate you doing this project and I hope that people will continue to tell the stories and remember the stories of these folks who, you know, basically like gave a big part of their lives for this mill and these mines because we, you know, our lives are built on their backs, you know, and so I really appreciate you taking the time to do the research. 

Alexis: Thank you so much. Yeah. Thank you for being willing to be interviewed. I really appreciate it. 

Joyce: Yeah, no problem. 

Alexis: I'm going to pause then.
